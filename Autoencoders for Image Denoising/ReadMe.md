## Implementing and Using Autoencoders for Image Denoising

In this project, we add noise to the MNIST dataset to train our autoencoder. 

We use Tensorflow to create a autoencoder which is capable of denoising images and improve classifier accuracy.

A short image of how a Autoencoder works can be seen in the picture below:
