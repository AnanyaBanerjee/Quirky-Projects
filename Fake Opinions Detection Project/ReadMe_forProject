The actual dataset for the project was >25MB and could not be uploaded here.
So, I have just uploaded the 1000 datapoints dataset.

There are 3 .py files:
1. Pj.py
2. Proj_Processing.py
3. Bow.py

The file Pj.py merges the two datsets meta.txt and reviewContent.txt on user_id, product_id and date to create a file reviews.csv

The file Proj_Processing.py performs pre-processing on the dataset and generates pre_processed.csv

The file Bow.py makes the BOW-TFIDF model and performs feature engineering and tests the model on SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost.

The details as to how the project was done can be found in the document Steps for Project shared in the folder.

The dataset which was used was Yelp's NYC dataset and the citation is mentioned in the project document.

Thank you!
