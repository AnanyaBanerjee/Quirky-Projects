923,0,3.0,-1,2014-12-08,The food at snack is a selection of popular Greek dishes. The appetizer tray is good as is the Greek salad. We were underwhelmed with the main courses. There are 4-5 tables here so it's sometimes hard to get seated.
924,0,3.0,-1,2013-05-16,"This little place in Soho is wonderful. I had a lamb sandwich and a glass of wine. The price shocked me for how small the serving was, but then again, this is Soho. The staff can be a little snotty and rude, but the food is great, just don't expect world-class service."
925,0,4.0,-1,2013-07-01,"ordered lunch for 15 from Snack last Friday.  On time, nothing missing and the food was great.  I have added it to the regular company lunch list, as everyone enjoyed their meal."
926,0,4.0,-1,2011-07-28,"This is a beautiful quaint little restaurant on a pretty street.  If you're strolling through soho around lunchtime, this would be a great place to stop for a bite. I heard the reviews about the lamb sandwich, so I had to try it. I'm very happy that i did. Every single ingredient - from the bread to the onions and tomatoes, the lamb and the sauce - was delicious. These four stars are well deserved because of the tasty sandwich and great ambiance.  I would recommend this place to anyone."
927,0,4.0,-1,2010-11-01,"Snack is great place for a  casual sit down lunch- especially on a cold winter day.  In many ways the restaurant mirrors the food- simple yet unique.  The avgolemono soup was lemony perfection and the butter bean salad hearty yet light.  The greek coffee is different...they sweeten it with honey which makes for an interesting thickness and sweet spice. I definitely plan on going back for dinner.  If the small space doesn't suit you their sister restaurant Snack Taverna in the West Village is just as good, if not better...and more ""upscale"" with waiters who make you feel well taken care of."
928,0,4.0,-1,2009-09-02,"A solid 4 stars for this greek food spot.  If you're a fan of lamb like I am, you must come here and try the lamb sandwich.  Amazingly tender and juicy with onions and arugula.  Also had a good greek salad."
929,0,4.0,-1,2009-08-25,"Let me start with a shout-out to everyone who is boosting the mint lemonade. That stuff is super tasty.  I refuse to believe you can get fresher, more delicious Greek food for your dollar.   I sport the lunch here regularly: huge sandwiches filled with marinated vegetables or succulent meats (the lamb is particularly choice) on a floury ciabatta with an ideal crust-crunch to soft-inner-womb.   The cold meze options are favorites.  I know that anyone can take good feta, cover it with salt, pepper, olive oil, and dish it up with some olives and tomatoes, but the quality and proportion of each of those ingredients is what makes it special here.  Heaven. You can rock a sandwich for $7.50 to $9.50 or grab bigger meals for no more than the mid-teens.  Get it done."
930,0,4.0,-1,2007-05-20,Love this place!  Try the Chicken sandwich or the Roasted Chicken.  Those are winners every time.  Really delicious and worth the wait.
931,0,4.0,-1,2005-12-27,"My friend and I were intrigued by the nightly entree special, ""Little Shoes,"" (eggplant stuffed with ground sirloin), and so we decided to eat at Snack. Although very tiny, we were able to stand while we waited and have a glass of wine at the narrow 'bar.' I absolutely loved the atmosphere, but I was a bit disappointed to find out that they were out of the entree special by the time we sat down. My substitute entree, Veg. Moussaka, was hearty and good, but cinnamon overpowered the other flavors. My friend had the stuffed tomato and green pepper plate, which I liked better."
932,0,5.0,-1,2014-05-09,"Stopped in for lunch today and couldn't believe how delicious everything was! My boyfriend and I shared an avgolemono soup, lamb sandwich, spanakoptikia and baklava. Everything came out super quickly and far exceeded our expectations.  The service was wonderful too! We will definitely be back!"
933,0,5.0,-1,2014-01-21,pretty cool place...good food...good people
934,0,5.0,-1,2014-01-20,"all around good place, cozy, I came in and didn't have a huge appetite but just stuck to the appetizers...which my friend and I did the combo platter of and we were more than full with it."
935,0,5.0,-1,2011-01-31,Fabulous Authentic Greek Food!!! This little spot is bold with great flavors. Knowledgable host that describes the layers of a food like you were sitting in the kitchen watching the preparation. If you are a true foodie you don't want to miss Snack!
936,0,5.0,-1,2008-07-07,Perfection.  Snack has become my favorite late lunch/early dinner spot.  Make sure to try the butter beans!!!
937,0,4.0,1,2014-10-15,"Tiny little place, but very good food. Pastitsio was especially good."
938,0,5.0,1,2014-10-10,I had the braised lamb sandwich and was one of the best sandwiches of my life. Do yourself a favour and try this place! Friendly service and cosy atmosphere.
939,0,3.0,1,2014-10-03,"This spot is close to my job so I decided to check it out for lunch. The prices are just about what you would expect for Soho/""South Village"" sit-down lunch prices; my meal came out to $20 for a mint lemonade and a decent-sized salad. I ordered what I think may have been a special, a roasted chicken & vegetable salad. The chicken was unbelievably dry, to the point where I had tough time chewing without choking a bit. It was served on a bed of arugula which could have chopped a little finer as it was in full, hard to eat pieces. When I eat a salad, I expect it to be cut down to make for easier bites. Not necessarily a chopped salad, just pieces that will actually fit in your mouth without chopping it up yourself. Basically, I don't want to use a knife to eat a salad. However, service was friendly & quick and the restaurant itself was comfortable, albeit tiny. I would go back to try something else, but probably not for a salad."
940,0,4.0,1,2014-09-16,"For lunch, my friend and I had: -Lamb sandwich, juicy and flavorful. -Roasted beet salad, pretty big portion. Good thing my friend shared it with me; otherwise I think I would so bored eating only beets, and a few leaves of greens. -Classic Greek Avolemono, basically a very tangy chicken broth with orzo. My friend really likes it at this place. The place is small. There are only 6 tables, but they do delivery. Good service if you decide to dine in."
941,0,5.0,1,2014-08-10,"Needed a quick, healthy light ""lunch"" and this place was perfect! Next time I'll definitely have yo plan better so I can try some of their hardier sandwiches and dishes. ALL the food looked AMAZING and the items we had were DELICIOUS!"
942,0,4.0,1,2014-06-17,Their artichoke chicken salad is good and plenty.
943,0,5.0,1,2014-05-24,"Some good Big Greek cooking!! Came to City on a gorgeous Sunday after a brutal winter one of the first clear sunny crisp Sundays to walk about Soho one of my fav's to do... And we were hungry and decided to try this hole in a wall gem!  Literally a hole in the wall which I think is perfect I believe they have 5 tables and it's so small the restroom is down the hall! The food is delicious...had the hummus, warm pita, lamb stew was fresh & just perfect, pastitsio (sp?) was perfect and portion were just enough! They dimmed the lights lit candles and it was a perfect way to end a Sunday...full tummy, wine, a real gem! The service is good hard not to be in such a small place! You feel like your in someone's home with other guest - the cooking is down home good!"
944,0,4.0,1,2014-05-21,"Needed a quick bite and stopped here because of the reviews.  It's really cute and small inside. Had the roasted sandwich and it was good.  Service was very friendly, too.  Nice place to break from shopping"
945,0,5.0,1,2014-04-10,Food was delicious and service was great. Good atmosphere for a quick bite alone or to catch up with friends.
946,0,5.0,1,2014-03-29,"Awesome hole in the wall place to grab a quick bite. Great music, great vibes and great service. The lentil soup and steak sandwich was absolutely to die for. The space is really small yet cozy."
947,0,5.0,1,2014-03-21,"I love this place! Great soups and Greek salad and spinach pie and tuna sandwiches. I've been a fan for years. The dining ""room"" is small and cramped but prices are low and the food is always fresh and delicious. I've only been there for lunch and look forward to going back for dinner. Services is fine -- not special - but more than adequate for a special little SOHO secret gem"
948,0,5.0,1,2014-03-08,The food is amazing! The service is equally amazing! My friends and I are definitely coming back to this place.
949,0,4.0,1,2014-03-01,"Quick, delicious and filling. After a few hours of shopping in SoHo we were starving. They couldn't accommodate the three of us at first (it's tiny), but took my number and called us back like 15 mins later. Fresh ingredients and the flavors hit all the right notes. The pastitsio was delicate, the hummus was creamy and the dolmades werent too dense, or tart. Service was with a smile, too. Definitely good to try on a mellow Saturday afternoon."
950,0,4.0,1,2014-01-24,"Delicious, consistent, well-priced. Food tastes clean and feels like its made with love."
951,0,5.0,1,2014-01-18,"Really quaint little ""hole in the wall"" kind of stop. Only a block away from the avenue of the Americas in Soho. There's only 4 tables for about 8 people at anytime but it didn't seem too much of a problem at 1:30pm on a Saturday. Really freshly authentic Greek food and pure cane sugar soft drinks were definitely something different. Definitely worth 5 stars. Relatively cheap as well."
952,0,5.0,1,2014-01-16,Delicious lamb sandwich
953,0,4.0,1,2013-10-17,"So... as you may notice from some of my other reviews... i am not the healthiest eater (.. I DO try).  Snack has about the BEST Greek Salad I have ever tasted.  Big juicy tomatoes... crunchy fresh cucumbers...fantastic olive oil dressing.  I don't eat greek salads typcially - but I do eat them at Snack...Actually, I crave them when visting New York.  You should try it!"
954,0,4.0,1,2013-10-02,"Novelty meets Mediterranean meets SoHo. This place can only squeeze in about 8-10 at 2 seater tables; and I do mean squeeze! But its a money spot for lunch or a quick on the go bite. Go for their lamb sandwich, the dressings are fantastic flavor pairings. If you're looking for something lighter for both your stomach and your wallet, try the soup. The Mediterranean sandwich is full of veggies too. Great variety, cute location, good food."
955,0,2.0,1,2013-09-10,"Been meaning to try this place for a while-highly recommended by a friend. Had the tuna sandwich...good but got TERRIBLY SICK after word. Also, sage tea was nice."
956,0,5.0,1,2013-08-22,"If you're looking for authentic Greek and a cozy atmosphere, this is the place. Seriously, it's cozy. There are maybe 5-6 tables in this place. However, despite it's tininess, the server was very helpful to each and every customer in the restaurant. My girlfriend and I had to wait a few minutes to be seated but he took the time to explain some of the Greek drinks and menu items to us. The service was fantastic and and the food was prepared very quickly, and though I'm new to the city, I'm certain it will stay on my list for a very long time as being the best Greek I have ever had. We ordered the Tzatziki cucumber yogurt, Houmus, and Tiropitakia cheese triangles. I strongly recommend this place!"
957,0,4.0,1,2013-08-02,"Great find in SoHo.  We could have been satisfied with the huge Greek salad and side of hummus, but also got a chicken souvlaki sandwich special that was killer.  It's a small place but really charming and worth checking out."
958,0,4.0,1,2013-06-23,"The taramosalata is to die for.  I recommend the Shrimp Santorini. Also, my good friend who is Greek loves this restaurant and says it tastes very authentic!"
959,0,4.0,1,2013-04-30,"What a pleasant little shop. Tiny, cute, liquor license, credit cards accepted, intimate....perfection ensues We went for a light dinner and ordered the roasted red pepper salad and the lamb koftikas. The salad had tons of red peppers, a bit potent, but very good. But the Lamb Koftikas, omg, have you ever wondered what you're doing wrong? What's that missing secret ingredient? Well look no further, it's pine nuts. How did I not know this, add it to meatballs and you're in for a treat. The wait staff was extremely pleasant and made wandering randomly into Snack a great experience. I will have to come back when I can eat more than half of an entree."
960,0,4.0,1,2013-04-16,"This place is TINY! I think it fits 10 people max. Keep that in mind when considering to come here on a weekend night. The food was great though and setting romantic! I recommend coming here if you're in the area and there is an open seat. Oh word of warning, but i guess it's standard for smaller shop establishments in NYC, i saw a roach on the wall here."
961,0,5.0,1,2013-04-10,Lamb sandwich... mmm... eat here.
962,0,2.0,1,2013-03-25,I ordered the spinach pies. Not very good. Soggy. No real taste. Also got the artichoke chicken salad. Portion size was huge but chicken was dry     .
963,0,5.0,1,2013-03-02,"This tiny cafe on Thompson has been a favorite of mine for years, and I'll tell you why. Everything is fresh and the attention to detail makes it a keeper. The lamb sammie on ciabatta is melt in your mouth chunks of lamb, with roasted onions and pretty much to die for. It's big enough for two gals to share, for sure. My favorite soup of all time, they rock here -- the Avgolemono is super lemony and perfect, with al dente orzo. Served with toasted slivers of olive oil coated fresh bread. And in every take away bag then toss little twists of waxed paper filled with a few Jordan almonds. Pretty adorable, since I'm a sucker for these little touches."
964,0,4.0,1,2013-02-20,I was impressed! This was my first time picking up food from Snack. I had no idea it was a Greek place after walking by a few times. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality at this tiny but quaint eatery. I'm half Greek so I've had a lot of Avgolemeno soup - I got the Snack version and was totally blown away! I loved the big orzo rice and the flavor was perfectly lemony and super delicious. The Chicken Artichoke salad was WOW! Its huge and there was a generous amount of roasted chicken and all of the other fresh and tasty toppings. My minor suggestion for the kitchen would be to cook the potatoes just a little more. But that didn't affect the overall amazingness of this salad. This will definitely be a place I will be visiting again!
965,0,4.0,1,2013-02-14,"Ohhh Snack. I love you, Snack. I order from here often since it's close to my work and their delivery is always precise and on-time. Their avgolemono and vegetarian souvlaki are fantastic and I hope that one day, maybe, I'll be able to replicate their giant beans in that delicious dill tomato sauce. I haven't yet eaten in the store itself, but I'm sure it'll be just as enjoyable as digging into my brown paper sack for the best (and still reasonably priced) lunch I can find in SoHo."
966,0,3.0,1,2012-12-19,"I don't understand the whole ""You can't order off the lunch menu if you're sitting down for dinner"" thing, especially when your restaurant is empty.  You'd think they'd be glad for the chance to earn a tip and the glass of wine or 2 I might order... but I guess not.  -1 star for that... The lamb sandwich to go though was pretty awesome.  I'd go back and try a sit down dinner, but I guess I wouldn't be able to have that sandwich again."
967,0,4.0,1,2012-12-15,"Perfect for what the name implies: great butter bean salad and even better winter soups. Perfect for dates or other one-on-one dinner. I wouldn't bring a part of more than four here - it's exclusively single tables and seats maybe 14 all together. Really a gem, especially because it doesn't advertise itself as a Greek restaurant, but the food is definitely Mediterranean."
968,0,4.0,1,2012-11-16,"Really delicious sandwich- had the lamb. It was enormous and I was able to eat it in two meals. Tight though, so I'd recommend grabbing and going. Definitely a neat block to visit for lunch if you ever get bored of Sullivan st. Plus they accept credit cards!"
969,0,2.0,1,2012-10-25,"I went to this place once before and LOVED it. I bragged about it to a friend and took her to eat there last week. Well, it wasn't good a second time around and that is a shame. We ordered the tuna salad, skordalia (garlic dip) and chicken souvlaki sandwich. The tuna salad was fine - I really can't complain about that. The skordalia was not fine and was more like soup than a dip. So watery and not authentic at all. The chicken souvlaki sandwich was ice cold. Like it was in a freezer. Also to add to the disappointment was the super weird waitress. Maybe she was overwhelmed or something..I don't know.  Anyway, can't say I'd go back and that's a bummer because I really liked it the first time."
970,0,4.0,1,2012-10-07,"Delicious, savory, creamy--try the pastitsio, vegetarian mousaka, stuffed grape leaves, baklava. Lunch-wise, I wouldn't recommend the artichoke/chicken salad--the big chunks of chicken resembled the big chunks of potato. Lovely atmosphere--just a few tables lined up along a mirrored wall, across from imported canned goods. Intimate at night, and bright and charming at lunch."
971,0,4.0,1,2012-09-16,Super small but it felt cozy rather than cramped. Get the lamb sandwich!!!
972,0,1.0,1,2012-08-12,"Lacklustre service, soggy lukewarm spinach pie and two-day-old cucumber salad. Go to Local instead!"
973,0,3.0,1,2012-08-03,"I am Greek, and a huge fan of Greek food, so a bit of a tough critic, but Snack is very good. Not fantastic, but pretty good. The tzatziki and hummus is awesome, but make sure to get extra pita!"
974,0,4.0,1,2012-07-25,"A friend recommended I try Snack - was really surprised at how much I liked it. The grape leaves were really good. I don't know what they put in them, but I'm pretty sure they laced them w/ amazing. The feta appetizer special equally good. Only ""eh"" was the grilled octopus, WAY overcooked, almost like it was day old microwaved. But, 4 out of 5 shared appetizers is a win for me."
975,0,2.0,1,2012-06-29,"Followed the great Yelp reviews to grab a sandwich here for lunch. Didn't realize it opens at 12, showed up at 11:50. The person working there opened the door and said they wouldn't be open for 10 minutes, which didn't seem like a big deal. Then she kept telling people it would be a few more minutes, until we were finally allowed in close to 12:05. I ordered the chicken sandwich and lemonade. When there was some confusion with whether we were paying together or separate, the same person who begrudgingly let us in expressed exasperation - she clearly wasn't having a good day. After we sorted the order, she told us to wait outside, in the heat - even though there were no other people in the place! The sandwiches were finally ready after 12:20. Snotty service, half an hour wait, $14 for a sandwich and a tiny lemonade... and the sandwich was cold, on a very tough roll and lacking flavor - I couldn't even finish it. Maybe I picked the wrong thing on the menu, but I won't be going back here. The Potbelly sandwich I had for $5.50 last night was much better."
976,0,5.0,1,2012-05-31,YUMS! I just tried the Carp Roe and it's sooooooooooooo good! I like the Feta with Tomato too! The Combination Platter is the jam.
977,0,3.0,1,2012-05-13,"I'm going to start off by admitting my rating may be influenced by the fact that I have to go way out of my way to get to this place. So I might be judging it more harshly because I expect it to be better given the effort to get there. Service is great. Everyone in the cozy restaurant is very friendly and helpful when it comes to suggestions of what to order. The place is probably best for a quiet lunch date as it is cramped. I definitely wouldn't come with a group of kids or girlfriends during a shopping excursion. I find the lamb sandwich incredibly overpriced (around $11) and definitely not worth it. It was pretty darn small and stingily filled. It has a lot of flavor while being flavorless. That is, I feel like the actual ingredients are kind of flavorless, the lamb, the vegetables, etc. but all the seasoning is an overpowering mishmash of tastes so you end up with something indistinct. The spanakopitakia are tiny little triangles of yummy, flaky, buttery, spinach-y goodness. They might be a little rich for some but I love them. Definitely great as an appetizer or as a light snack on their own. The baklava is good. Not spectacular but everyone has their own preferences when it comes to baklava. I find the layers a bit too dry and I wish the flavor was a little more nutty and less dependent on spices for taste. Overall, I'm not sure if I'll be back but it's a nice place to stop in if you're in the area. I will say that the times I've been in I've seen people ordering salads which looked delicious so maybe that's their specialty."
978,0,2.0,1,2012-04-30,"Stopped in for lunch takeout during work.  I asked the server what is better: Roasted Vegetable Sandwhich or Vegetable Souvlaki.  He replied boastfully with the Vegetarian Souvlaki.   Apparently he enjoys tzatziki sauce running out of his pita, down his hands and all of his face.  Unfortunately, I do not.  The taste didn't make up for the mess!"
979,0,4.0,1,2012-04-11,"Delicious.  Get there early for a seat, or better yet, order take-out and snag a table down the block in the corner park. Favorites:  Artichoke Chicken Salad, Feta Cheese Meze --"
980,0,5.0,1,2012-03-30,"I was trying to wait until after my headrush died down before posting, but it has been an hour and I am still relaxed and in a great mood from the Lamb sandwich.  It was fantastic, got it to go."
981,0,4.0,1,2012-03-13,mmm very tasty. Kind of cramped though.
982,0,3.0,1,2012-03-05,"Nice little Greek restaurant that serves authentic Greek dishes but don't go if you're looking for a gyro (the only type of Greek food I'd ever had). Its a very small, quaint restaurant (seats a total of 10 people). The food was very good (I had a veal and rice dish) but the portions were just a little small."
983,0,4.0,1,2012-02-22,"a whole in the wall, but get there outside regular lunch hours and it's all good Salads are nice portions and very tasty Mint lemonade is delicious very tasty lamb meatballs I guess if you go there more than 10 times, it's a good sign. nice staff too no 5 stars because it's quite impossible to go there with more than one person"
984,0,4.0,1,2012-02-13,Small place big on taste. Stopped in with my wife after shopping. Absolutely delicious. very friendly waitress too
985,0,5.0,1,2012-01-05,most neighborhood-y place in the neighborhood.
986,0,3.0,1,2012-01-05,"This place is nice but the menu is very limited. Food is very good, as is the service. Space is really small, so make sure to get a reservation."
987,0,4.0,1,2011-12-18,We would love to come here more often. But its a small place and there is always a long wait. We like everything we've tried and will definitely come back again.
988,0,3.0,1,2011-12-13,"Snack is an adorable little restaurant. It is quite small, so you'll have to be comfortable being very close to your neighbor. We went for dinner. The menu is heavy Mediterranean.  There weren't any sandwiches on the dinner menu. The service was good. There is a very small greek wine list and beer menu. I am not a huge fan of either. The food was good. They have great thick pita. The humous was spicy, which I wasn't expecting, but loved. We also had the spanakopita, also pretty good. We shared the chicken dish, which came with delicious green beans. The potatoes were a little bland. For desert we had the baklava. Very good. A little different than I've had I think there were cloves in it.   Overall, we enjoyed the meal."
989,0,5.0,1,2011-12-08,"Living near by, I come here all the time. The food is great, the staff are friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Absolutely recommend it-- great for a date."
990,0,4.0,1,2011-12-04,"My friend and I stumbled in here purely by accident- but it was a happy accident! We were just looking for some lite bites and what a perfect find! We both had the classic Avgolemono soup, and although it was a bit on the salty side, it was fantastic. We also split the Roasted 1.0 sandwich, which was also very fresh and very good, and a generous size. It's such a cute, cozy atmosphere with a bit of 50's diner edge to it. Our waiter was great- so cute/friendly. I really enjoyed it here! I think I'll go out of my way to go back there again."
991,0,4.0,1,2011-11-10,"This place is so small, they have 5 tables inside and it's pretty cramped. We ordered: - Greek Iced Coffee: So good! Coffee lovers, you have to try this. - Some lemon soup? Very citrusy, but I love lemon, so I thought this was very refreshing. - Lamb Sandwich: Loved it, my friends ordered the Tuna Sandwich and the Chicken Sandwich, but I liked mine the most. The lamb was cooked and flavored well. Good place for a meal if you enjoy eating Mediterranean food."
992,0,4.0,1,2011-10-28,"I stumbled upon this cozy spot one shopping afternoon, weary with hunger. My actual thought @ the time was ""I need a snack,"" when I  looked up & saw the sign. True story. The ONLY problem with shopping in SoHo is that there is a lack of affordable, tasty food choices. Snack is a welcomed spot. The 2nd thing that made me come in was that they have a ""people on yelp! love us"" sticker--& they definitely deserve it. The food is well proportioned, affordable, & delicious. It's not super cheap, lunch will run you a few dollars shy of $20, but it's more affordable than anything else in the neighborhood. I recommend the Lamb Sandwich--& I don't like lamb."
993,0,4.0,1,2011-10-18,"Snack is a solid pick!  On a sunny Monday in mid-October, the restaurant was full of people.  While the tables were occupied, the turn around was fairly quick.  With a hospitable, friendly wait staff, I did not feel rushed.   I enjoyed the Greek Salad.  Although modest and simple, the freshness was definitely apparent.   I will go back again -- from what I have heard, the savory pies are to die for."
994,0,4.0,1,2011-09-27,"What a wonderful Greek restaurant!  We had to wait an hour to get a table, but it was worth it.  They make every classic Greek favorite you could possibly be craving.  Everything we ordered came out tasty, fresh, and delicious.  We also enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and the super nice and accommodating staff.  The waitress was honestly concerned about how long we had been waiting.  She checked in with us and offered us a place at the bar to stand and drink while we waited for our table.  They were just absolutely wonderful and the food was great!  We will definitely be returning!"
995,0,5.0,1,2011-09-23,"It may have been rainy outside, but Snack was cozy, toasty...and Greek! I arrived just-in-time to snag a warmly-lit window seat and avoided the dinner rush!   The super-friendly waitress kicked things off with a flight of savory spinach and cheese pies.  For my main, the veal meatballs made fast friends with prunes and a red wine reduction.  I washed it all down with a cup of honey-spiked tea.  I'll definitely have to hit this mediterranean oasis again! (I'm curious about the iced, Greek coffee.)"
996,0,4.0,1,2011-09-18,Exploring SOHO and after searching for what felt like an eternity for non street vendor food we stumbled on this gem. Saw all those great reviews on their store window so decided to go in. This small little resto impressed with big flavours and fresh ingredients. Ordered their lamb sandwich (so yummy) and chicken slovaki sandwich. I wish we had a place like that here in Toronto.
997,0,4.0,1,2011-09-04,"On a Friday night, my boyfriend, my roommate, and I were craving Greek, so we were excited to find Snack was so close to us. We got worried when we noticed that the whole restaurant was 4 or 5 tables, but luckily they were able to seat us right away. We ordered tzatziki to start, I got the avgolemono as my meal (wasn't too hungry), and both my roommate and boyfriend got the lamb stifado. The boyfriend had been eyeing the boneless lamb rib, but the server told him if he was hungry, it probably wouldn't be enough food. We also had baklava for dessert. The tzatziki was definitely five stars. Creamy, flavorful, and served with soft pita triangles fresh out of the oven. Even better, our waitress refilled our pita basket several times when we asked! The avgolemono was also really good and had lots of lemon to it, although I would have liked a bit more orzo and more than two bits of chicken in the whole bowl... Both my roommate and boyfriend loved the lamb stifado. The lamb was tender, perfectly seasoned, and the portion was generous. It also came with a delicious rice pilaf. The service was also very friendly, and you could tell our waitress knew the menu well. The only reason Snack doesn't get five stars is their baklava. While it was a pretty big portion, it was really dry. All in all, I'd definitely go back, but I don't think we'd get the baklava again."

999,0,4.0,1,2011-08-01,"Came here for dinner. They do not have the chicken potato butter bean salad for dinner, which I was craving, but the upside is I got to explore other parts of the menu. Like the gigantes bean salad. I could eat a double portion of that with some pita for dinner. The flavors here are fresh and delicious, and their pastitsio is like a favorite memory - beef and mac and cheese wrapped in cream and nutmeg and cinnamon. Upscale comfort food. I had the little shoe, which is like the vegetarian mousaka plus ground sirloin. I love this place - it churns out really heartwarming meals. I just wish it was slightly less expensive."
1000,0,4.0,1,2011-07-11,"The salad special (poached chix, goat cheese toasts, tom, eggplant, etc etc) was SO GOOD! The dressing is tasty enough to make anything delish. Cute (and tiny) place, too."
1001,0,5.0,1,2011-07-09,Very good food
1002,0,4.0,1,2011-06-17,"Just got back to my desk, I can still taste the insane goodness that was the highly recommended lamb sandwich. I know, I should wait until the spell has worn off to review my lunch. I don't care, THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW. Get the lamb. Just do it. $16 for lunch for 2 people, we split the lamb sandwich (how many times can I say 'lamb' in this review?) and the tzatziki with pita. The sangwich was perfect. The aioli was unlike any other I've had, though I'll admit I don't eat enough Greek food. It had some bite, so the tzatziki was a perfect, cooling accompaniment. Don't have the same complaints about it being a tight space since we sat on one of the 3 benches outside to enjoy the day. I definitely think take-out is the way to do lunch here. lamb lamb lamb. (7, and those 3 count)"
1003,0,3.0,1,2011-06-12,"Snack is a tiny restaurant tucked away in the village with a dim, casual, and cozy ambience serving authentic Greek food. It's more of a take out style Greek restaurant with table service. By night, candles appear on every table, and a separate menu for dinner is served that's not available during the day. The waitress had to pull out the table, also very tiny in order for me to sit on the inside without disturbing the table next to us. Even if you're a double zero you can't fit through the space in between the tables, which are only inches apart. There's no privacy, I heard everything loud and clear from left and right. Since it's such a small space, the waitress is constantly by your side and making sure if everything is all right. We enjoyed our meal with soda from Boylan (100% natural) and Greek fruit juice. Every dish has a nice blend of fresh ingredients. 1. Tzatziki - Greek yogurt dip with crunchy shreds of cucumber, served with warm pita. 2. Spinach Pie - More like a thin triangular hot pocket than an actual pie, flakey crust, and the right amount of filling. 3. Greek Salad - It's still a salad, not much to say. 4. Vegetarian Mousaka - Eggplants, mushrooms, potatoes with béchamel sauce, like a vegetarian lasagna. 5. Braised Lamb Stifado - Flavorful and tender lamb with tiny sweet onions comes with currant, apricot and almond pilaf (flavored rice)."
1004,0,3.0,1,2011-06-06,"it is small and really cute place in SOHO. Clean and friendly service. I had the greek salad - it is over priced. The portion is small and it has only feta cheese, cucumber and onion. Taste is good and I will probably go back, but the portion is too small compare to the price."
1005,0,4.0,1,2011-05-31,"I crave Snack's delicious food at least once per week. I love so many dishes on the menu.  The veal meatballs, the lamb sandwich, the tasty Greek salad and the freshest tzadziki make me happy.  I also love the lemon potatoes and have been known to cobble a meal out of those and the aforementioned tzadziki. Everything is quality and they have excellent Greek wines on the menu."
1006,0,5.0,1,2011-05-26,"I have a confession to make! While observing Pre Easter Lent I was dreaming about 2 things: steak from a grill and a lamb sandwich from Snack... Thats how good it is!!! Don't get me wrong, there is a wide variety of amazing items on their menu, it's just that particular sandwich really got my soft spot! My personal conspiracy theory is that they actually put some kind of a drug into it, like those Chinese ppl do, so you just HAVE to come back for more!!! The place itself is as small as it is cute. Perfect for a little get together with a long lost friend, but I would assume reservations are required for dinner hours... The staff is super cool, attentive and accommodating. Considering the fact that I am a very detail oriented person, I get so excited about eating there, that no matter how many times I go there ordering the same things, I always forget the name of their special Greek coffee, which apparently is a frapuccino and an iced one for that matter, haha. I wrote it down last time i was there and now they will finally have to stop making me that complimentary batch of my imaginary coffee. I think that $14 for lunch is pretty steep of a price, but I do believe it is worth it, thus I cannot take off not even a single star!!!"
1007,0,4.0,1,2011-05-10,Just grabbed lunch here for the first time. Got the pikilia plate. Will definitely be coming back again! Helpful staff and they made my to-go lunch order quite fast.
1008,0,4.0,1,2011-04-30,"Really charming and intimate setting-- don't understand why the restaurant is called Snack, but the Greek food is great. Our favorites were the veal kibbe/ meatballs (they melt in tour mouth) and roasted feta which was off the menu. We had the mixed mezze starter which was also very nice, but all three dishes are more than enough for two people.. Our waitress was fantastic and really knew the menu inside and out. Will probably return soon..."
1009,0,4.0,1,2011-04-18,"This place awfully small, but don't under estimate the place size for the quality of food. I really enjoyed eating here, it seems they make it fresh once you order, it's not per-made food. I ordered spinach and cheese puff (i forgot the real name), but taste yummy. Tips: Place gets crowded after 9 pm"
1010,0,4.0,1,2011-04-05,"Oh my goodness! For some reason I have never gotten into Greek cuisine, but after one dinner here, consider me among the converted. This place made me think past feta cheese and gyros and opened up a world of delicate, delicious Greek delicacies. Portions are surprisingly big -- after just two appetizers I was forcing myself to finish my entree. The place is TINY, so get there early (even on a weeknight), because it fills up fast."
1011,0,3.0,1,2011-04-03,"Decent mediterranean place. The space is very small, but the dishes are fresh and the service is friendly. A little overpriced in my opinion, and I don't understand why there's an extra charge for pita, especially with soup or hummus... Beet salad is very fresh, but too large for being JUST a beet salad. Soups are also tasty and hearty, in particular the lentil soup, but a tad on the salty side."
1012,0,3.0,1,2011-03-24,"Small and simple Greek restaurant with some original items on menu. Food was good, not great and a tad over-priced. Seriously, $16 for some hummus and pita?"
1013,0,5.0,1,2011-03-15,oh my god.  i literally just finished the vegetarian moussaka two minutes ago and i can say without a doubt that this is one of the best lunches i've had in a long time.   ordered takeout so can't comment on the dining experience but i will definitely be back.
1014,0,4.0,1,2011-03-05,"What a lovely little find! Super cutesy little precious jewelry box of a restaurant. I came here for lunch on my own and found it empty, save for one other patron. There are only about five or six tiny little tables, so I imagine it would be tough were it crowded, but it's the perfect spot to dine alone. I ordered the pastitsio without really knowing what it was and HOLY CRAP. It's a beefy, macaroni-y, béchamel-y pie of goodness in your belly. The server was sweet and chill and they serve Boylan's sodas. I will be back!"
1015,0,5.0,1,2011-03-05,"How did I not know about this place?! This place is one of the cutest places ever. It's a small place with about 5 tables so get there early if there are more of 2 people in your party. We arrived around 9 so it was pretty busy but we hung out and had some drinks while we waited. The food is so fresh and delicious. We ordered a bunch of plates to share including the tzatziki (wow), lemon potatoes, herring (amazing), greek salad and greens. It was all completely delicious. The guys that work there are high on life which completes the dining experience as I really didn't want to leave. I will definitely be returning to this little wonder."
1016,0,1.0,1,2011-02-09,"Fellow Yelpers, Beware!!! They serve yucky hard croutons with their cold mezzes rather than pita. I have been eating here for 6 years and today was the last straw. Is it really that costly to include some pita with a dip appetizer? Also what is with the attitude of the staff on the phone. Boo Snack Boo. I will no longer be eating here. Now I need to tweet about it..."
1017,0,2.0,1,2011-01-13,"Disappointed in SNACK b/c its super convenient and just the right size to be a neighborhood favorite...if it were good that is. OCTOPUS was truly just bad -- shouldn't have eaten it but was hungry so gulped it down.  They have no business serving it like that when the Greeks arguably do the best octopus preparation in the world.  Don't get this dish if you go to SNACK. The Saganaki was fine. Nothing to write home to Athens about. The eggplant special (stuffed with ground sirloin and covered in bechamel) was tasty -- but overpriced. Lastly -- god bless the man  -- but the waiter was KILLING ME with nonstop commentary and obsessive-compulsive chattiness about every single thing.  He like didn't stop taking to my dater and I the entire meal - -which is cute at first, and then it becomes a hassle.  Really dont mean to sound ornery but this guy really needs a lesson on how to serve people: friendly, yes; cloyingly attentive and pal-ly, no. id skip it. Wow SoHo really does have a restaurant issue that needs to be resolve.d Where do people eat moderately priced weeknight meals??"
1018,0,4.0,1,2011-01-02,"Snack is a simple, tiny little restaurant tucked into Thompson St just north of Spring.  I stopped in for quick snack around 5:30 Wednesday (12/29) to hold my date and I over before our late dinner reservation. The time is important because they stop selling sandwiches after 6 pm so luckily we just made it in time to try the Lamb Sandwich.  I don't eat a lot of lamb or Greek food in general but I was blown away by the flavors and the balance of this sandwich. I really have no idea what was on the sandwich because the I couldn't quite read the small text on the chalkboard menu from my seat.  I saw lamb and my date suggested we share it along with some hummus.  I was famished so I really didn't take the time to look at what was on it either.  I just know I enjoyed it. Small, hole in the wall of shop but great food and good service.  Price wasn't bad either (for NYC).  I think the sandwich and hummus was only around $14 or so for the two of us. Check it out if you are in the area but be sure to go before 6 if you want a sandwich."
1019,0,5.0,1,2010-12-31,"snacks, to me, are tasty little tidbits of happiness... and snack is just that!  tasty and little.  i admit i was still hungry after eating here, but everything was delish.  i'd definitely return, but either i'd eat a little something before, or not wait until starving before coming here!"
1020,0,2.0,1,2010-11-15,Hmmm soso.... I can't much about it other than nothing really note worthy
1021,0,4.0,1,2010-11-11,"Snack is simple, but good - like its name! The service is always good and nice and friendly! I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki lunch sandwich, simple but good and hearty. The chunks of chicken are huge so the sandwich alone will fill you up. The special soup they make is good too - basically all of their sandwiches and salads are tasty with fresh ingredients. Can't go wrong!"
1022,0,4.0,1,2010-11-01,This place is really charming.  It is a great place to have a low-key lunch.  The food is simple and effective - you should go.
1023,0,4.0,1,2010-10-24,"Great lamb sandwich (version 1.3) for $10. As a software programmer, I'm amused that their sandwiches have version numbers."
1024,0,2.0,1,2010-09-25,Lunch here is great. I always look forward to the lamb sandwich which is incredible. Unfortunately we just got back from dinner here and it was abysmal. Everyone raves about the eggplant dip and rightly so. It was the  highlight of the meal. The octopus was absolutely disgusting. I knew we made a mistake the moment the plate was put in front of us. Totally unappetizing presentation and I truly almost gagged as I bit into it. It tasted and smelled like cat food. I love octopus. This was an abomination. We left and grabbed some ice cream around the corner just to get rid of the taste in our mouths. Seriously what are they thinking with that dish??
1025,0,2.0,1,2010-08-23,"We walked halfway across Manhattan for this restaurant and I wish we had stayed at home.  It was decent food, but it seemed I could get the same from a corner deli.  The flavors seemed bland and the menu cryptic about actual ingredients in the salads.  I will give kudos for pleasant wine and attentive, but not overbearing service."
1026,0,2.0,1,2010-08-15,"The best dishes here merit four stars, but the food is uneven. The roast chicken entree I had was terrible. Even the dark meat was dry. The breast was so dry that it took two glasses of water to get it down. I know it's only one dish, but plain chicken is really a good test of a kitchen's quality. It's easy to make a bad one because you don't have anything to hide behind -- and this kitchen failed on it. The prices are indeed low by the standards of quality restaurants in NYC, but they achieve those prices by skimping on expensive ingredients like meat and substituting large quantities of rice, potatoes and other starches to fill you up. If you like starches more than meat -- like most of the women I eat with -- that will be fine with you and you'll happily pocket the savings. If you're a meat lover, it's false economy."
1027,0,4.0,1,2010-08-10,Very charming spot with delightful servers. The Artichoke Chicken Salad ($11.50) was very hearty and was enough to feed two. Kudos to the young barista who prepared my Frappe. Perfection.
1028,0,3.0,1,2010-07-30,"I had the greek salad - it was good.  My only complaint was the price.  $9.25 for a small to go salad.  it has the most feta I've ever had in a salad, the dressing was great, the seeds were taken out of the cucumbers, the were just the right amount of red onions, but it felt more like a side than a lunch entree.  Maybe I'm just not used to NYC prices yet."
1029,0,4.0,1,2010-07-21,"Came here for lunch with my coworkers.  All of the reviews said the sandwiches were great, but I opted for a savoury pie instead.  I'm glad the pie came with a Greek salad, which was both authentic and delicious.  The four cheese pie was a bit dry and not quite as savoury as advertised, but still filling.  I'd likely come back here and get a sandwich next time.  Also, we spotted a celebrity here and that was pretty cool."
1030,0,4.0,1,2010-06-01,"Holy sandwich. tuna?  sublime chicken? delish tea? tasty service (not part of sandwich, per se)? awesome lunch, well-served."
1031,0,3.0,1,2010-05-27,"I have been to both Snack and Snack Taverna... Snack is great for lunch or a light dinner, I think their food is fantastic, clean simple food. I love all their salads and pretty much everything I ever had there. Problem: the place is SMALL and it is ANNOYING to be squashed while you eat and more ANNOYING to be watched as soon as your done so they can turn the table over... Snack Taverna's food just isn't as good..."
1032,0,4.0,1,2010-05-23,"Very good Greek lunch!  The avgolemono soup, greed salad and lamb sandwich rocked."
1033,0,4.0,1,2010-05-21,"Holy cute place, tasty morsels of food but tiny to the tune of fitting 10 people into the dining area max, That's probably being generous. Either way Snack has awesome fresh dishes and is a great place to get away from the crazy tourist areas in SoHo."
1034,0,2.0,1,2010-05-14,"As far as Greek goes,  ""meh. I've experienced better"", and the worst part is, I've had better food that was far less expensive. Snack is a smallish restaurant that's a bit too big for it's breeches.  If you don't live or work in the neighborhood, or get lazy after work and order expensive takeout as a last resort (me), I'm not sure why you should go out of your way to have weekend brunch or dinner here, although I can see how it draws a lunchtime work crowd for sandwiches.   Speaking of going out of your way, I LOVE, nay CRAVE lemon chicken soup (which is always part of my Snack repertoire when I do order here), but if I were a billionaire living on a remote island in the Caribbean, I'd have my soup flown in from Mykonos in Miami and not Snack (remember, I'm a pretend billionaire so I'm not being a cheapo on jet fuel). Same thing with the lamb meatballs, beet salad, and the roasted chicken, I can immediately think of better restaurants in New York to order those dishes from.   Since I'm not a billionaire or even a millionaire, I will continue to spend my hard earned money elsewhere until the lemon chicken soup craving turns me into a monster and I have to feed."
1035,0,4.0,1,2010-05-12,"The weather was amazing last week and I decided to take a walk to Snack with a friend after a coworkers recommendation.  I was told the place was tiny (the entire place can only seat 10 people comfortably) and that we should just order the sandwiches to go.  Fortunately when we arrived, there was one open table and nobody waiting so we promptly sat down. The menu has many healthy options and you will not feel guilty about what you ate afterwards.  We started off with the eggplant dip and I had the lamb sandwich while my friend had the tuna sandwich.  The eggplant dip was a very normal affair and did not stand out too much.  My friend enjoyed her tuna sandwich even though she did note the tuna was a little dry.  If it was just based on those two items, I would most likely given the place 3 stars, but the lamb sandwich was so amazing that it bumps it up to four.  I do not know how long they stewed the lamb, but it was so tender.  It was complimented with a sweet and savory tomato aioli and served on light and fluffy ciabatta bread.   I could go back to this place and order the lamb sandwich for the rest of my life."
1036,0,2.0,1,2010-04-21,"This place has been disappointing to me. I've been couple of times and I couldn't help to notice that there are some recurring problems: 1)certain food they have is good (the eggplant dip is my fav), but other things on the menu are horrible (I had the octopus and trust me if I say that it was the worse octopus I had in my whole life) 2)the portions are small, and the prices are quite high 3)the waitresses were both times not very nice I feel sorry because it's a really cozy place, and I love greek food, however I really don't think this a good spot in you are looking for great and faily-priced food."
1037,0,3.0,1,2010-04-07,"a quietly pleasant nook less polished than its older brother snack taverna in the same neighborhood. snack however is far more comfortable and on an afternoon lunch break is choice place to eat. memorable foods include: greek salad, beet salad, avgolemono soup, melitzanosalata, roasted and vegetarian souvlaki sandwiches. the entrees are more expensive and come in smaller portions, so be proud you are good to your wallet and love sandwiches, it's alright, no worries. they keep a small and selective menu meant for the soho pocket. expect fair to helpful service in a low key upper middle class environment. vegetarian and meat-friendly without a hitch as greek/mediterranean food normally is [3.5 stars]."
1038,0,5.0,1,2010-03-30,"This was a great stop for a bit of GREEK yumminess!!! I emphasize the Greek because I was slightly lead to belive that this place may offer some falafel delicacies but this is a true Greek experience. The food is fresh, fantastic and a huge bargain in my book! Lunch combo was $12 and it could have been shared. The sandwiches are huge and amazing, try the Tuna. You will not be dissapointed. A winner for me ;)"
1039,0,4.0,1,2010-03-12,"I've eaten at Snack a few times and I've always had a good meal. As others have noted, anything having to do with lamb is delicious here.   The location itself is tiny, but I've never had to wait for a table. The prices are good. Anything on the lunch menu and most of the dinner items are either well priced and/or worth it. The stuffed peppers and tomatoes did not merit a $17 price tag despite being very tasty. The service was great and the atmosphere was cozy. Definitely go here for the lunch-time lamb sandwich!"
1040,0,4.0,1,2010-03-08,"I've been going to Snack ever since it opened, over 8 years ago. It's teeny tiny, so odds are that you will have to wait on a bench outside for a table.  The food used to be amazing and has gotten a little unpredictable, but in general I would recommend the Avolegdomo (perfect if you have a cold), lemon chicken soup with orzo. it's tasteful and tangy.  The Spanikopitika (spinach triangles) are delicious in a flaky filo dough. Salads - go with the butter bean salad.  For entree, the shrimp with orzo is really good."
1041,0,4.0,1,2010-03-02,"If you're shopping in Soho, stop by here and grab an iced coffee. I love iced coffee and this one is really special. Otherwise, come for dinner. Grab a couple of friends and squeeze into a tiny booth. Order a bunch of things to try (particularly the fava bean dip and the hummus) and get your snack on. If you get a bottle of wine, they will serve it with water glasses. What's not to love?"
1042,0,4.0,1,2010-02-24,"it's hearty comfort food. we came here for lunch last week. we had the chickpea and fennel soup, the spinach triangles, and the lamb sandwich. their portions are enormous - we were stuffed. their sage tea is a standout. the place is tiny and cute - charming simplicity. our waitress was nice."
1043,0,4.0,1,2010-02-21,"A very pleasant surprise. $19 buys you a delicious Braised Lamb Stifado (the meat literally falls off the bone) - served with a sweet, fruity rice pilaf and tzatziki. The saganaki appetizer is a winner as well; while I'm naturally inclined towards fried cheese, I found that this imagination of the Greek Classic straddled the fine line between being too greasy and being undercooked. The space is crowded and small, but for a quick, cheap bite - it shouldn't really matter. The service exceeds expectations."
1044,0,2.0,1,2010-02-19,"So went to this place with my colleagues, it is small and cozy and the service is good. Unfortunately the Vegetarian Souvlaki I ordered was sub par, it was missing flavor, did not have the variety of vegetables that I am used to at other places which serve souvlaki and in all honesty was small compared to other places. I definitely will not be going here again but my colleagues did say the lamb sandwiches were good."
1045,0,5.0,1,2010-01-26,They told that they don't deliver to the NoHo. I was crying to the phone. Because the AVGOLEMONO SOUP and the LAMB SANDWICH are dying the best food after a crazy night. And a lemonade... Can I become a permanent Saturday morning customer?
1046,0,5.0,1,2010-01-26,My favorite restaurant hands down! My friends and I have been coming here for over 5 years. Im kinda obsessed with the avgolemono and will get 2 bowls. Love those crunchy breads. The mint lemonade is perfect in the summer.
1047,0,4.0,1,2010-01-18,"Wandered soho one luncheon afternoon... a co-worker and I couldn't decide what we were in the mood for...until we bumped into Snack.  Considerable good reviews thanks to yelp...so we decided it's a must try.   Everything we ordered was pleasantly tasty.  My chicken sandwich was pretty kick ass, considering I do not like hard, cold bread.  (actually, minus the bread, I'm going to ask for pita next time)... My co-worker got a beet salad and a spinach pie.  Both phenomenal choices.  I love Mediterranean food with all of its thick hearty sauces, olives and olive oil.  YUMMY.  Needless to say, I think its sister restaurant ""Snack Taverna"" will be just as spectacular.  I am ready for a good meal anytime.   Forewarning, it's so TINY, it's unforgettable.  5 tables, squished together.  When you've got people waiting for tables to free up, yeah, it makes you just a little bit uncomfortable. OH, and if you haven't already recognized the brand, (I sure hell's didn't), their mediterranean dips & spreads are all over NYC and MA. Double yum to hummus!"
1048,0,3.0,1,2010-01-17,"I really enjoyed my experience at this tiny yet tasty restaurant. To be honest, the first big plus was that we were seated almost immediately in this 12-seat restaurant. (Try going past 8pm.) My friend, Jennifer S., and I got the fava to start, and it was very tasty. A thicker texture than hummus. (And we got extra pita for free!) I also got the Classic Greek Avgolemon, which was my first time for this traditional dish. And any soup afterwards will be forever compared to this one. Jennifer S. said that it was missing the chicken, but even so, it was a very flavorful dish. Jennifer got a special of the day lamb dish, which was uniquely flavored but, in my opinion, a bit expensive for the quantity. I did appreciate that although there are very few tables, we were not rushed out of the restaurant. (Though, once people start waiting for seats inside the tiny space, you'll automatically feel guilty for staying too long.) So... great food, but a big expensive-o, in my opinion. I am glad I got the chance to try it once!"
1049,0,4.0,1,2010-01-16,"Have only been once, with coworkers for lunch.  We didn't realize how tiny it was, but they were very accommodating in seating the 6 of us.  Most of us followed the waiter's suggestion and split the 3-dip appetizer and got the lamb sandwich as the entree.  Boy, did we over order!  The dips were good, but it's what I expect from hummus-type dips.  However the lamb sandwich was amazing -- I was expecting slices of lamb to the pull-pork style of lamb was a surprise.  The texture, the cinnamon-y flavor, the crusty bread... Oh man I'm drooling on my keyboard just thinking about it.  Half-sandwich is more than enough for a light lunch and eating the whole thing can lead to food coma.  Definitely coming back to Snack!"
1050,0,4.0,1,2010-01-06,"I just wet myself....in a good way. From attacking this amazing soup! Literally my lap and face are covered in creamy lemon, chicken broth HEAVEN at the moment. First off I must begin by saying this is the first time in 3 years I have actually wrote a review on yelp while at the same time eating at the place I am yelping about. Lexy can MULTI TASK BABY! Ok back to my soup. SERIOUSLY, why have I not tried this before? There is so much more to typical Greek food than the ""Greek Salad"", Grape Leaves and Chicken. I had my lunch delivered to my office this afternoon and I decided to try the two things that everyone on yelp has been raving about here. 1) Avgolemono Soup (Their Classic Greek Soup) 2) Lamb Sandwich So far the Soup is amazing.. (take a few more slurps as I type). It has the perfect balance of bitter lemon, creamy goodness, chicken broth and rice. In other words.. it's HOME MADE GREEK CHICKEN SOUP! I will never eat any other type Chicken Soup again, I'm complete. Ok, now for the Lamb Sandwich... (holding sandwich in hand and preparing my mouth for this meaty goodness) Open... Open... Bite... Tasting... Tasting... Swallowing... YES! OH MY LORD. This is one amazing meat sandwich... soft, flavorful, a wonderful mess in my mouth! I can't type anymore.. must finish eating. LAMB SANDWICH and Avgolemono Soup, DO IT or DON'T BOTHER. ;o)"
1051,0,4.0,1,2010-01-03,"I've been going to Snack for close to 5-6 years. My favorites are the avgolemono soup (I always order two), the cheese triangles, the lemon lentils, the greek salad, the beet salad, and the sandwiches. The garlic potato dip is POWERFULLY garlicky. I would order their entrees more often if they weren't so gigantic. Between the food and the cozy ambiance, I'd give it five stars but I had to take one away because: it's tiny. Five tables. About 1/3 of the time I go, I'm so hungry that I end up getting my food to go and sitting on the bench outside or near the playground. The other reason I took away 1 star is because they keep using this blond waitress that was hired last summer or spring. She's the worst. The first time I noticed her, she got my order wrong and insisted that I had ordered what she thought I did, even though I order the same couple of items and what she insisted I ordered was not one of them. Then when our food finally came, she kept coming by and trying to take away the plates even though food was still on them and my friend was still eating. The table next to us also kept saying they weren't done with their food when she tried to take away their food. She forgets orders frequently and I'm just confused about why they keep her on if she can't do her job correctly even though she's only overseeing 4 two-seat tables and 1 three-seater."
1052,0,4.0,1,2009-12-29,"Oh my gosh. I went here with a good friend during a lady date; neither of us had ever been before. There are only about 4-5 tables (seriously), so we had to wait, but sweet Jesus...that lamb sandwich. I would wait a year for that beauty. So tender and flavorful, on bread so fresh! It was a dream come true for my mouth. Topped off with a mint lemonade (one of my favorite things) and it made for an absolutely fantastic and memorable lunch. I'll be back for sure :)"
1053,0,4.0,1,2009-12-10,"Snack is a tiny restaurant with lots of flavor!   I went for dinner - which apparently has a different menu than lunch - and ordered the fava as an appetizer and the boneless lamb for my entree.  Yum and Yum!  When I first get my meal, I thought that I wouldn't be full by the end, but I am still stuffed!  I suppose it helps that I ate the fava with pita bread (which was warm and chewy).  I also tasted my friend's classic Greek soup - also terrific and very authentic.  I had a Greek roommate my first two years in NY and I swear this was just as good as his homemade ""Greek Penicillin"" (basically chicken broth with egg, lemon, fresh ground pepper, and orzo).   The service was fine, nothing really special.  But I was impressed that even though my and I had one of the four coveted tables, they never rushed us out for one of the couples waiting to be seated. I will have to go back for lunch and try the lamb sandwich that everyone seems to rave about on this lovely site we call Yelp."
1054,0,4.0,1,2009-11-29,"I went here because sincerely, I've spent too much during my nights out and I need to start saving for my year-end trips... hence, logically focusing more on the cheap eats. (and obviously going out on fewer dates) I went to this place expecting average food and I'm glad I was really wrong about this place. There is nothing average about the lamp sandwich. It is simply amazing.... I had a mint lime juice which was OK. I thought the mint was going to be crushed or something but all the mint i got was a leaf in the drink. Staff was really nice and quick, the sandwich came out in like 4 minutes. My friend had a chicken sandwich which was really good too. The only thing that bothered me is that the appetizers were a bit overpriced in my opinion. Beware: this place has only greco-turkish style coffee, something relatively hard to find in the city. Its a hit or miss depending on the individual tastes of people. I love that kind of coffee. Reminds me of the time I used to roam the deserts of Northern Africa."
1055,0,5.0,1,2009-10-30,"A friend who used to live in NY gave us a three page list of her favorite restaurants to try in NY, but she said that if she had to pick just one place to endorse, Snack would be it. We trusted her judgement and had a delightful dinner in this tiny little SoHo spot. We are lucky to have gotten in - we walked in on a Sunday evening, about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed and they were able to accomodate our group of 4. There were several parties that walked in afterwards that all got turned away since there was no more seating and the kitchen was closing. I had the lamb stew which was so tender and flavorful, the BF raved about the mousaka. Our server was absolutely delightful and attentive and enhanced an already fabulous meal. I would definitely come back here again on my next trip to NYC and just make sure I'm here early enough to guarantee a spot at one of their 6 tiny tables."
1056,0,5.0,1,2009-09-29,"Thanks to my little Yelp friends, I knew to pop in here after a day of shopping around SoHo. Great find! On a Sunday night, we were the only ones in there and had the waitress' attention all to ourselves. This paid off because during our wine selection process, she let us taste every white wine on the list, plus gave us her personal wine commentary. Surprise surprise, we picked her favorite wine. The pastitio kicked ass - evenly balanced sweet and savory. Lamb rib appetizer was flavorful but could have been a tad bit more tender. It was clear that this was a 'regulars' spot. After a while, one or two more people strolled in, pulled up a chair, busted out a book, and the waitress brought them their standard order. It's rare to find such a local gem in the vast bustling city but I'm glad I did. Well worth every moment!"
1057,0,2.0,1,2009-09-26,"Hmm. So far, I am not impressed. Stopped by to grab a sandwich for take out. Woman behind the counter clearly wished me to hurry up and make a decision. I placed my order and she gave me the total: $8.15. I wanted to give her exactly that amount but she would not take my five pennies to make up the five cents in 15 cents. ""Oh, no pennies. He doesn't like pennies."" (Who is ""he""? Am I supposed to know?) And who doesn't accept pennies? Aren't pennies money? So you'll take my dime but not my pennies? Wtf? I gave her a quarter instead, and of course I got back a dime. Just what I need: more change. She told me to sit outside and that my sandwich would be brought to me when ready. Fine, as there were no seats inside anyway. Sat outside on the bench. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. 15 minutes go by, and I""m wondering seriously how long it takes to make a bloody sandwich. So I go inside to ask about it. Turns out my sandwich has been sitting on the counter this whole time. The girl (a different one now) behind the counter says, ""Oh, is this yours?""   What, do employees not talk to one another in this place? I mean, I could sit all day on the bench outside and watch the yuppie families pile their DKNY-sporting toddlers into their luxury SUVs, but I think I ordered a sandwich because I'm hungry! The sandwich, as it turned out, was really good. Lovely ciabatta bread, fresh ingredients (I ordered the marinated sandwich), and all-in-all delightful. But when Alidoro is only half a block away, I think I'll give Snack place a miss next time."
1058,0,2.0,1,2009-09-15,"Hummus Place is way better.  Snack is a rip off. I got a platter of three appetizers.  It cost $13, so I was expecting a decent amount of hummus but Snack gave me three little containers and not even enough pita to eat it with."
1059,0,4.0,1,2009-08-26,"Small and cozy. Agreed that customer service could be better. Anyways, best way to avoid them is just grab to go and eat at the park on Thompson and Spring. My favorite of what I had so far is the lamb sandwich. A good 8"" long, floury ciabatta holds a generous portion of well flavored braised lamb, sweet onions, and arugula. Tuna sandwhich is pretty good too. Hard-braised yellowfin tuna with artichokes, tomatoes, cucumbers, portobello mushrooms, scallions and shaved viahotiri cheese in a lemon vinaigrette on ciabatta bread."
1060,0,4.0,1,2009-08-17,"Food is fresh & tasty!  There is very limited seating & they won't seat until entire party has arrived (even if you are a party of 2!).  The Fresh Mint Lemonade was very refreshing!  Recommend the 4 cheese pie, Greek Salad and the Chicken Sandwich."
1061,0,2.0,1,2009-08-14,"INCREDIBLY rude. So rude you know they are TRYING to be rude. I place a large phone order for our office, well over $100 worth of food, and the entire time on the phone the guy was as rude as possible. The culmination of the rudeness was so surprising that I'm not even angry, I'm just shocked: After ordering 6 entrees already, I said: Oh I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce the word for the cheese triangles, how do you say that? GUY: Cheese. Triangles. There are no words. That kind of rudeness is purposeful! That said, the food was good, although the portions were TINY, especially in comparison to the price. Everything we ordered said it came with pita, but we ordered 10 entrees and received ONE PITA cut up into 10 pieces. No joke. They sent these covered almond dessert things in the bag and I kept trying to figure out how they can be skimpy with PITA, which is so cheap, but then give us a handful of almond for no reason? I'm sure the almond things were more expensive than the pita . . ."
1062,0,5.0,1,2009-08-03,"10 seats. genuinely friendly staff. but the food, the food was super fresh, homemade, and rich with flavor. their homemade taramosalata was marvelously salty. my souvlaki was yummy and fresh. def returning."
1063,0,4.0,1,2009-07-23,decent greek food.  i had an eggplant/ground sirloin special.  it was pretty good.  wish i had tried the lamb.  :)
1064,0,4.0,1,2009-07-14,"I dont know much about lamb, but I consider myself ""experienced"" when it comes to sangwiches. The chef here seems to also be experienced in the art of sangwiches. The bread on the lamb sangwich (which is only available during lunch or for takeout) is incredible. I don't even recall what other ingredients were involved, I was stuck on the bread."
1065,0,5.0,1,2009-07-07,"Absolutely fantastic, Snack was my oasis from work when I worked down in SoHo. If it's your first time their and you like lamb, you must try their braised lamb sandwich. Extremely tender and juicy, sometimes too juicy, haha, and amazing depth of flavor. You'll be going back to try everything else, which won't disappoint. Friendly staff!"
1066,0,4.0,1,2009-07-02,"Love this place. Its the perfect little place to come for lunch and also dinner. The food is consistently good and comes out ultra fast.  The only real complaint is that the service can sometimes be a little abrupt - but whatever this is NYC.  Must haves - Lamb Sandwich, Butter Bean Salad, Saganaki and Mezze Plate."
1067,0,5.0,1,2009-06-30,"Snack has become my new favorite lunch spot in SoHo. My favorite things to order are the vegetarian souvlaki (love the butter beans) and spinach pie (which comes with mezze or Greek salad). It is only a 5 minute wait for take out usually and the service is great. The food has always been very tasty and as a someone with a big appetite, I really appreciate the large portions. Also, the lemonade and baklava are delicious as well."
1068,0,5.0,1,2009-06-30,"feta mezze with warm pita and tomatoes. perfect summer food!  light and delicious and simple. followed by a bite of my lunchmates butter bean salad - also very, very tasty. then i had the (drum roll please) lamb sandwich.  the place is very tiny, as has been mentioned, but the lamb sandwich would make it worth the wait!  we were seated within 5 minutes, but the place seems to thin out around 2pm.  they also have take out (YAY!). you can also sit outside on a bench ... very cute. the waitress was really sweet, and she kept our water filled, although i was concentrating more on my mint lemonade.  not sweet, at all, and very basic, again.  delicious. the sandwich was ginormous, and i could've had just that, but where's the fun in that?  i don't think the prices are all that high.  for lunch this delicious, this fresh, and this fast?  i think y'all are nuts!  $8 or $9 for a huge lamb sandwich?  not that crucial."
1069,0,4.0,1,2009-06-19,Just had dinner at Snack for the first time last night.It is extremely small! I mean I think there was seating for maybe 10 people. There seems to be a very brisk takeout business. Our waitress was really nice .I had the tzatziki with warm  pita bread and it was great. Also the stuffed pepper/tomato entree-also great. Other people had the mezze platter  and the grilled shrimp with ouzo in the sauce which they enjoyed.The prices are a bit high for this place. I seem to complain about this alot  in my reviews. Maybe rents are high -who knows?
1070,0,4.0,1,2009-06-17,"After perusing great lunch options within the SOHO area I found this gem.  Since I'm a fan of lamb (more lamb!!), I was intrigued by the lamb sandwhich (officially, the lamb 1.3, I believe).   Lamb 1.3 was great. Now as for the service coordination, while not poor, was a tad odd.  Because the place is so small (very few tables, that's fine), I asked for my sandwhich to be bagged up as 'to go' (naturally, since I had to sit outside, fine with that), however, I really wanted to have a beer with the sandwhich; couldn't do that, so I just ordered and waited for food to be bagged up.  While waiting, two tables cleared (and were never re-seated during my entire stay) and I asked if I could be seated at the table, because a) I would prefer to eat inside and b) I would like to order a beer.  To which I received this puzzling response (paraphrasing): 'I'm sorry, you can't have the table since they are already bagging your food"".  Hmmm...so, I was willing to spend more money, but it was like the $10 minimum clock had been reset (which there is, definitely understand why with such a small place).  So, I ate on the bench, original order, tables not filled and a further revenue stream from a customer stopped in it's tracks.  Oh well! Also, signs post for $20 minimum for credit card orders (personally, that should align with the $10 minimum for being seated inside).  Just a heads-up. I would definitely recommend."
1071,0,4.0,1,2009-06-12,Came here for lunch and -- like many others -- went with the lamb sandwich. I've got to say I agree with everyone else. It's really good.
1072,0,5.0,1,2009-05-17,"It will be a long while before I will bring myself to order anything but the Lamb Sandwich. Once you find perfection, why fight it?"
1073,0,4.0,1,2009-05-06,"I've only eaten the marinated vegetable sandwich (on multiple occasions), but it's so good, I've got to give the restaurant 4 stars. The interior of the restaurant itself is absolutely tiny, so if you can't find a seat and the weather permits, by all means take your sandwich (or other bench-appropriate meal) outside to eat on one of the benches outside."
1074,0,4.0,1,2009-05-03,"I've been wanting to try this place for ages--but wasn't hungry enough, wasn't able to score one of the few tables, etc. Finally made it in tonight, and was duly impressed. Prices seem high ($6 for a dip with one pita, $11-$15 for appetizers, $18-$20 for entrees), but portions are huuuge. Two of us split the ""Pikilia"" (a  mixed mezze platter) and the stuffed eggplant special. The Pikilia consists of four dips, four stuffed grape leaves, olive and lemon garnish, which comes with two fresh pitas ($15; $1 each for extra pitas). The roasted eggplant one was great--the carp roe one was a bit salty though. The stuffed eggplant dish ($19) was delicious--the eggplant was sweet and tender, and the ground beef filling was perfect. It came with a side of rice and lentils as well as a small plate of greens ($6 if you buy it on its own). Service was friendly; water refills were frequent. Alas, I was completely stuffed and had no room for dessert ($4 each). The meal was remotely ruined by a table of drunken douchebags, and since the place is small, it turned into a bit of an ordeal.   I'll be back though, if I can manage to get a table again! Tip: There's take out and delivery here if you don't want to deal with the wait ($10 minimum for the latter)."
1075,0,5.0,1,2009-04-27,"Wow.  Two words.  Lamb Sandwich.  Succulent, tender, & bursting with flavor.  The mint lemonade on a hot spring day hit the spot.   I can't wait to go again to try everything else on the menu."
1076,0,5.0,1,2009-04-27,"Love this place.   Every time I need to get my fix of Mediterranean food, this is the place to go.  The dipping platter with fresh pitas is awesome.  The Greek wine and beers are all great.  And all the dishes are sooo delicious.  If you want a nice, comfortable, good dinner for an average price, Snack is the way to go."
1077,0,4.0,1,2009-04-08,"was there for lunch thursday and had the gigantes bean salad and the mint lemonade. the beans? gigantic! ;) both were delish, the service was nice and friendly, and they have the setup locked down. very organized. very cute. it's super small but cozy in that don't-get-too-close-to-me kind of new york way."
1078,0,4.0,1,2009-04-07,"I had the pleasure of placing a large corporate lunch order from Snack the other day.  The acting manager was extremely helpful, providing recommendations on how much to order for the group and promising to have our meal arrive by 1:30 pm.  Even though the deliveryman got a bit lost within our building, he still managed to arrive at 1:30 pm on the dot.  I could not have been happier with the service.   The food, itself, was just as impressive.   I ordered one of the combination platters to start, choosing the Carp Roe, Roasted Eggplant, and Hummus dips.  The carp roe spread had a fresh, fishy flavor.  The eggplant was uniquely smoked and provided a positive grilled after-taste.  The hummus was some of the creamiest I had ever tasted.  However, while I enjoyed the silky texture, I would have preferred a bit more flavor from the spread.   The accompanying pitas were comfortingly soft and warm.  The Greek Salad was crisp and fresh, but a bit over-dressed.   However, the team was blown away by the tasty Artichoke Chicken Salad, which actually included little lettuce.  The lack of roughage was compensated for by large hunks of tender chicken, potatoes, butter beans, tomatoes, and string beans.  This earthy combination was tossed in a savory black olive vinaigrette.  I also helped myself to a slice of the delicate Spinach Pie.  The moist phillo dough melted in my mouth, leaving the bold spinach and gooey cheese filling to gratify my taste buds.  The hearty pie satisfied without being too dense.  It was also served with our choice of cold appetizer or side Greek salad.  To top off my order, I purchased a variety of sandwiches, all of which were quite large and priced between $7.50 and $9.50.  I tried half of the Marinated 1.0 and fell in love with the lemony mix of artichokes, tomatoes, cucumbers, portobello mushrooms, scallions and shaved cheese.  The Mediterranean ingredients were stuffed into a large, crisp ciabatta roll.   This tasty meal solicited cheers from my colleagues...another order well placed by the resident foodie :)  As I predicted in my conversation with Snack's manager, we will be ordering from this tasty Greek cafe again!"
1079,0,5.0,1,2009-04-02,"I finally went back today! I was so happy :) I think this place is such a wonderful place to go for lunch, definitely worth it! A good place to get the food to go, and go sit in the sun and eat your lunch at the park right a couple of steps away. It's inexpensive and of course delicious! The lamb sandwich was DELISH, all the flavors went together very well. I couldn't decide to get the spinach pie or the chicken boureki. Ended up with spinach, i guess that just means I have to go back AGAIN to try the chicken =P Love love this place...but the ppl who work there are kinda of not very friendly...but it's new york...not california...so oh well. I'm just there for the food."
1080,0,5.0,1,2009-03-28,"All I have to say is ""Lamb Sandwich to go please"" --- probably about once a week and life is good!! Haven't had much of the other food there. Did try a Greek salad that was a standard Greek salad but with very fresh produce."
1081,0,5.0,1,2009-02-25,"Awesome!  Make sure you try the greek salad and the eggplant spread.... very tasty.  The grape leaves are good, but not to-die-for. For the meal I went with the spinach pie, and washed it down with diet birch soda, which actually tastes good.  Not ""good for a diet soda"" good, but just ""good"". And yes, save room for baklava."
1082,0,3.0,1,2009-02-19,"Was compelled to update my review after dinner last night. I went to snack at around 8:30 - 9:00 pm to get takeout on my way home from work. Previously I think I went on the early side and they charged me lunch prices. In my old review I said: ""Vegetarian Moussaka to die for. $14 and change after tax is a little pricey for every night."" WELL... if it's dinnertime, the vegetarian moussaka is $19.50 including tax. Variable pricing annoys me, especially when it is exactly the same dish. Just because eggplant is a nightshade vegetable, doesn't justify charging more for it after dark. It's still great food BUT the value is just not there at almost $20. Service with a smile wasn't included in that price either. If snack standardized pricing on entrees and suggested that their staff be friendly to people giving them money, I'd gladly go back. For now there are better options in my neighborhood."
1083,0,4.0,1,2009-02-19,"super cute place--the kind you love stumbling into after walking around soho on a balmy saturday with a friend. and what luck that that is exactly what happened to me! window shopping takes a lot out of a girl so my friend and i decided to stop and get a bite to eat at snack. and boy was i glad. lamb sandwich? to die for. juicy, flavourful, perfection. wasn't a fan of the greek coffee though, and it was a bit strange going outside into the apartment complex to visit the loo, but aside from that, the perfect spot for a snack--just as the name suggests :)"
1084,0,4.0,1,2009-02-16,"These types of places are what make NYC such a culinary destination. Small, cramped, and full of flavor....loved it. My girlfriend claims their lamb sandwhich is the best ever and I got to say that everything I tried was on point. If I ever opened a place like this down south all the folks would go crazy over elbow room, but in NYC you can open up great things in someone's walk in closet and be doing good business. Great lunch spot in Soho and you should definately go"
1085,0,4.0,1,2009-02-15,This tiny place may not be impressive on the outside but after a few bites you'll realize that this place doesn't serve your typical diner Greek food. I had the Vegetarian Mousaka which was good however the mushroom was a little overpowering.  Perhaps the Pastitsio would be a better bet for those not crazy about mushrooms. The lamb sandwich was also very good.  The lamb was very flavorful and tender.  The portions were also very generous. Make sure you save some room for the Baklava.  It was pehaps the best I've ever had.
1086,0,3.0,1,2009-01-30,"Looking for a casual lunch place in Soho, I found Snack to be the highest rated in the area. I actually wasn't very impressed with the food although I liked the cute ambiance. The place is really small ( 4 tables total) but our servers were extremely nice and accommodating. I got the chicken sandwich..I felt the chicken was bland and not spiced enough..i liked the bread and sauce but overall I really wasn't that impressed. My boyfriend got the lamb sandwich..which he enjoyed..so that might be a better bet?!"
1087,0,5.0,1,2009-01-12,"My wife and I were in NYC in Jan for a weekend get away from San Francisco. I had heard about Snack after researching lunch spots in Soho and so we decided to try it. Bottom line is that it ROCKS!! Very cool, little, cozy spot with about 5 or 6 small tables. The food is amazing if you like Mediterranean and we love it. The lamb sandwich is off the charts for flavor and taste. Check this place out, you cant do any better!"
1088,0,4.0,1,2009-01-05,"Alright, alright, alright, alright. Alright, you close at 10pm something. Alright, I walk through a residential apartment hall to get to the restroom. Alright, dinner is a touch pricey. Alright, you're parking me into my table. S'aaaaaalllllll okay--- BECAUSE YOU ARE FUCKING DELICIOUS. And fucking cozy. And I admire your fucking integrity for making absolutely everything on site. THE GREEK SUN, I taste it in your food. YOUR MOUNTAIN TEA,  you put a serious dollap of wildflower honey in it that actually tastes insanely floral. If I was a rich girl... I'd marry you and I wouldn't change a thing. By the way, if one orders Snack's platter of samplers and drinks they're set. Have a friend help--- Snack's portions are generous."
1089,0,4.0,1,2008-12-15,"Greek soup buttery, milky chicken broth with lemon Oh my God.....BEST SOUP&UNIQUE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE@@ chicken sandwhich is great too. But expensive..especially the greek salad was dame small. But thinking about their rent in Soho ..maybe I have to understand."
1090,0,5.0,1,2008-12-09,Wow. I would leave my review at that if people didn't think I was being sarcastic or facetious. I rocked out with the Chicken 1.7 which was by far one of the best sandwiches I have had in 2008. All of the ingredients worked so harmoniously that I nearly sang along with it. If you are down in SoHo and want something awesome and made with care...check this place out. Wow.
1091,0,5.0,1,2008-11-11,Amazing - great place for lunch. Food is sooo delicious and well worth the little wait for a seat in a cramped space.
1092,0,4.0,1,2008-09-16,"Yummers! I accidentally passed by it because it is such a tiny little place with only four two-persons tables.  Surprisingly, the food is incredibly tasty and rich in flavor (but not over powering).  I had the special ground beef stuffed egg plant and my friend had a fish dish.  Holy cow, we were both so happy with our own dishes and tasted each other's dishes too.  If I lived in NY I'd probably make this one of my frequent stops. :)"
1093,0,4.0,1,2008-09-03,"Delicious!  I got the lamb sandwich with no onions.  The bread was slightly toasted, but not at all hard.  The lamb itself was juicy and a bit too chewy for my taste, but still very good.  The sauce was tomato-y and somewhat spicy.  The entire thing was $9.75, and it was large enough to fill me up.   As others have said, the place is very small, so there's a good chance that you won't have a chance to eat in (especially around lunchtime).  I recommend taking it to go, and then eating at some of the tables that are just down the block (assuming its not too cold).   If you're planning on spending less than $20, bring cash."
1094,0,4.0,1,2008-08-19,"Snack completely lived up to the yelp reviews.  Adorable tiny place with just a few tables, and a moderate sized menu and lots of nice light things to choose from. The tzanziki was creamy and garlicky, the eggplant dip so fresh, GREAT strong greek olives, a small greek salad (god i hate giant salads, who eats that much salad?) some spanikopita, and it was all good.  I was bummed that they were out of the hummus and the keftedes but thats one way to know that everything is really freshly prepared.   Make sure you end with greek coffee-- a rare treat.   One drawback-- dont go with 3 people unless you're prepared to squish.  Cuz its so small they cant give you two tables for 3 people, so you basically are smooshing 3 people into a table for 2."
1095,0,4.0,1,2008-08-18,"Tasty, not cheap enough for what it is. You can get a good sandwich to go for only a lot of money (rather than a ton), and it will be fresh and yummy.  If you are willing to travel for Greek, go to Kefi.  If you want a fresh cucumber sandwich in Soho, come here."
1096,0,4.0,1,2008-08-18,"Grabbed a late lunch while shopping in Soho on Friday afternoon... Made the mistake of ordering pre-frozen spanakopita... Pucker-faced on sour, mint-less lemonade... Rejoiced with lamb and chicken sandwiches on super-chewy bread!"
1097,0,4.0,1,2008-08-12,"We went to snack for sandwiches, although their pies looked really good, too. The sandwiches were yummy. They are served on bread which has a crusty outside and a nice chewy inside. It's delicious, but can be difficult to bite through in a sandwich. The hummus was not at all bland and was served with freshly baked pitas. I also got the mint lemonade. The lemonade was perfect: not too sour, not too sweet, but there was no taste of mint. All in all, a great lunch spot. Lots of vegetarian options. There is a $20 credit card minimum."
1098,0,5.0,1,2008-08-03,This is one of my favorite Greek places in the city. There are only a couple of tables here but if they are full they take your cell phone and call you when a spot opens up. The food and service is great.
1099,0,4.0,1,2008-07-30,"Loved the food!  I went mid-afternoon so it was not crowded and it was a very pleasant, mellow experience.  The chicken lunch special was delicious and just as good as I've had in Greece.  Yummy!"
1100,0,4.0,1,2008-07-18,"Snack is absolutely adorable. It's just a tiny place with a handful of tables, with benches outside to sit and wait (good place to people watch). I used to frequent this place much more often because I had a dreary little job and it was in walking distance from said job. It was my little respite away from the office. I was happy to see that it hadn't changed one bit. It was still as delicious as ever, when I went a few weeks ago for a casual lunch with a friend. The ingredients are as fresh as ever, and the portion sizes are great for what you get. I love moussaka as a rule, and they do it well. Also love the keftedes and stuffed grape leaves. Sandwiches are good, too! I love Snack! Eat here!"
1101,0,3.0,1,2008-07-16,"Very cute and romantic- made the mistake of coming with a friend. Seems like a place that should be for dates only. They were out of a lot of things I would have liked to have. The skordalia was good but tiny for the price. The veal meatballs were excellent and filling. I bet the sandwiches are good, but they weren't available for dinner (I don't think... ) Bathroom situation is really odd... you have to leave the place and walk down a hall."
1102,0,5.0,1,2008-07-12,"After an iPhone ordeal, my girlfriend and I felt the need to treat ourselves to something small, tasty, elegant, filling and fun.  This was definitely what we found.  Though it's small, the food is amazing and the service is professional but laid back.  Our server made fun of the beer names and casually joked with us.  We sampled the to-die-for soup with a couple of beers, she had the shrimp and I the chicken (though I envied the couples around us with tons of amazing apps and snacks to share) which was more than filling and well worth the $18 each.  We finished it off with the best baklava I have ever tasted. Though the size, space, signage and servers are modest, this place will overwhelm your taste buds and help you feel down-to-earth rich.   NO LONGER cash only, $20 minimum on major cards."
1103,0,5.0,1,2008-07-09,"Authentic! My Father is as Greek as they come. This place mirrors his ingredients and yummy flavor combinations. When I eat the Greek Salad (Cucumber, Feta, Onion, Tomato, Olive Oil, Oregeno, Etc) I am transported to my backyard as a kid - eating summer dinner with the family. It is very tiny & Cash Only. I find it easy to go here right after work to get a table w/ friends. You will not be dissapointed. I would go as far to say best Greek food in Manhattan."
1104,0,4.0,1,2008-06-24,"Ideal for ordering out, Snack offers delicious, um, I-cant-spell-it-lemony-chicken-with-little-pasta soup as well as quality tzaziki and hummus.  Recommend sharing the cold aps with a friend, though, as they give you quite a lot.  Not pricey but not cheap - still, a solid choice for a tasty work-day snack."
1105,0,3.0,1,2008-05-05,"My boyfriend and I went to Snack for Lunch today. The waitress seemed really stressed waiting the 5 tables that were inside and so the service was a bit slow. I had a cherry juice and he had a frappe- both good, though I'd recommend the latter. Each entree came with a ""mezze"" or appetizer. We ended up with a pie off the specials which was wonderful, stuffed tomatoes and peppers (good, light, a bit bland), feta salad, and tzatziki (best i've had in a while). Pita is an extra dollar. Overall it was a tiny bit expensive and slow but fun, as you have a nice view of the street."
1106,0,5.0,1,2008-04-30,"Snack is one of the places I miss most about previous days I lived in NY...you just can't find vegetarian souvlaki like this in Denver. I make a point to stop here every time I get back to visit. It is great for take out lunch, although a little small for dinner (even by NY standards)"
1107,0,3.0,1,2008-04-29,"Pros:  The food is actually very good Cons:  Someone who doesn't drink wine or any alcohol for that matter must have picked the wines on that list... I don't see how it could be any other way.  We ordered a bottle of white and I swear it tasted like someone poured out half the bottle and refilled it with Milwaukee's Best or Natty Lite.  Also, the service was not very good or pleasant, which is very strange considering you can't possibly fit more than 15 people in the entire restaurant."
1108,0,4.0,1,2008-04-07,"Cool place for a quick bite to eat  ($$ - decently cheap) if they have space (they only have like 5 super small tables in a row). I got the chicken and potatoes special which was excellent. Their hummus was okay, but not great. The place is small so don't expect to have a private lunch here... Definitely a perfect spot for a little shopping sustenance."
1109,0,4.0,1,2008-04-04,"this place is tiny so getting seat can be a feat.  if you are lucky, get some mint lemonade.  it's nice.  i got the portobello and roasted red peppers sammy on cibatta.  it was good, but drippy.   it did the i'm taking a bite the contents are squishy out.  i still enjoyed it despite the falling apart bit.  felt like the waitress was rushing us out, but could understand with people waiting to eat.  would definitely go back to try the combo platter.  choose 3 items and pita galore."
1110,0,5.0,1,2008-03-13,"I was visiting NY and I told my friend to pick a place that she'd never been,  and lucky for me, she chose Snack. There are only about five tables in the entire restaurant - I actually couldn't believe we got a table without a reservation, but it all worked out. My friend is Greek,  and grew up eating Greek foods, so she ordered our food. We had the most amazing cheese triangles and the eggplant spread - both amazing. We also shared the lamb dish which was fantastic. Overall a perfect experience, and as an added bonus is was very inexpensive."
1111,0,5.0,1,2008-03-08,"Ok, I admit it.  I've never been a huge fan of Greek food.  I'm reminded of this place in Minneapolis, It's Greek to Me -- and eating this really, really REALLY tough octopus appetizer there.  I don't remember any other dishes there, though I ate their several times in high school in an attempt to be cool by going ""downtown"" or Uptown (yes, as in the Prince song too). Snack changed my mind. Creamy cucumber tsatsiki. Savory veal meatballs, bespeckled in pinenuts. Flaky spinach pies (how do you spell that?!). Oooooooh yeeeeeaaaah. We really liked the prices, portions and ambiance too."
1112,0,4.0,1,2008-03-05,"Ducked into this extremely small space (a tiny storefront on Thompson) on a rainy Tuesday afternoon and scored the last table (out of maybe 5 or 6) and had a very filling, very good lunch. The highlight was the butter bean salad ($8), a generous helping of large butter beans over a bed of arugula and topped with a lemon vinagrette. The well-reviewed lamb sandwich ($9) was HUGE (you can split this), but was as good as promised. Eyeing the other tables, the dips and wraps also looked delicious. The only downside was that at 3pm they were out of the tuna sandwich and the spanikopita. But that's what  really what we risked with having late lunch. Otherwise,  what we had was excellent."
1113,0,4.0,1,2008-03-01,"I actually missed this place even after I read another Yelp review warning me I would miss it and resolved not to! This dark slice of a restaurant has no bold lettering or color to catch you but doubletrack, search and hunt until you find it because the experience is WONDERFUL. First of all, you are really squeezed with exactly 8 other people, if you only came with one person. And I recommend you come with either 1 or 3 people, exactly. But I liked being squeezed because I am outgoing by nature and the snatches of conversation I overheard were hilarious. Anyway, my friend and I split the lamb sandwich (as feverishly upheld by other Yelpers) and baklava. The lamb was incredibly soft, juicy and flavorful while the bread was the perfect foil: dense, sturdy and crusty. The baklava was comparable to other baklavas I've had. I would say Kashkaval's is crispier and more held together. However, as I glanced around the table, I compiled a list of what to order next time, with a group of 3: Meze such as hummus, tsaztiki, white beans gigantes, any of the soups (they looked divine), and the lamb sandwich. I can't wait until then!"
1114,0,4.0,1,2008-01-25,"Literally a hole in the wall, but delicious food. Try the veggie moussaka, the hummus...really, anything. Probably have a better chance of getting food if you do takeout instead of trying to get a seat, as I doubt that it has more than 10 chairs, but it's worth the wait."
1115,0,5.0,1,2007-12-07,"One of my supervisors recommended this place to me. I walked passed the place twice (very unassuming, small door). Once inside, I was surprised to discover that the space underneath my bed was bigger than this establishment. Good thing I was just picking up my order. So I got the greek salad with the chicken bourlaki (doubt I spelled that correctly). Whoa, this stuff tastes great. Probably the best greek salad I've had to date. And the lamb sandwich is M-azing. Definitely a diamond in the ruff... Tip: If you must eat-in, ask someone if it's ok to sit on their lap. Otherwise, plan on eating on the benches outside."
1116,0,5.0,1,2007-12-04,"perfect lunch spot when you want something light and fresh and pretty.  I had the artichoke chicken salad and it had beans in it the size of my brain.  Have you ever had a mouth full of bean?  It's fantastic!  The bigger then bean, the better.   I'm totally coming here for dinner one night after work for sure."
1117,0,5.0,1,2007-11-18,my big fat greek lamb sandwich. took my visiting cousin from chicago here after she had done time at some of ny's fancier establishments and was in the market for some real food..     braised lamb that falls apart.   ciabatta-esque bread.   arugala.   get it.
1118,0,4.0,1,2007-11-06,"I gotta say, I was very impressed with Snack.  How did I not know of this place sooner?  Oh wait...I know.  'Cause it blends into Thompson St. so well that unless you know where it is, you can easily walk right by it!  Spurred by Sam and Russ's reviews, I decided to spice up my lunch routine and grab a takeaway from Snack.  Quick service, small location, GREAT food.  I tried the Lamb sandwich which was not only wonderfully flavored and smelled so delicious that I had to prevent myself from just stopping in the middle of Prince St. and start my chomping.  The only complaint one might have would be that the bread gets quite soggy 'cause of all the lamb juice drippings.  But hey!  I'm not complaining!"
1119,0,5.0,1,2007-10-16,"Yogurt place ll - not Snack also on ....71 Sullivan Street (between Prince St & Spring St), New York, NY 10012 Why is this place so cute? I never knew yogurt could be so this good. Located in Soho this little Greek boutique is hidden way on 71 Sullivan street btw Prince and Spring. This little shop is full of all thing Greek, from cookies, baklava, spinach & cheese pies and of course homemade Greek yogurt. Originally form East Elmhurst Queens they have branched out to Manhattan severing locals and tourist alike. I got a cup of creamy rich 2% cows milk yogurt for $2.50 that was accompanied with apricot syrup and slivered almonds but one has choices with a verity of syrups and toppings. Also with my little afternoon snack I got couple of almond cookies for $.50 (each), apricot cookie $1 (each) and a spinach & cheese pie for $2.50. All perfect for making your rounds on a nice cool fall afternoon. RANTS & RAVES: All is homemade goodies, not really full meals however the yogurt with granola would make a great breakfast that is full and healthy."
1120,0,3.0,1,2007-10-11,"Yummy. I much prefer dinner to lunch. I've ordered take-out for lunch a few times and every single experience was sour. For some reason, the lunch crew is just not as friendly. Plus, the dinner menu is way better. Think it's worth mentioning that there are about 12 seats at this restaurant so prepared to wait if you go during a popular dining time. All in all, it's a cute little place for a relaxed bite that isn't fussy."
1121,0,5.0,1,2007-09-25,"So yeah, you all know the fighting over the lunch place story.  Clearly great Yelp minds think alike.   The owners of this place and Snack Taverna on Bedford have the modern Greek cuisine down pat!  The lamb sandwich is epic and divine, the atmosphere is adorable, the service was fantastic, and the mint lemonade was expertly crafted (you'd think Mint + Lemonade + Sugar would be an easy concoction - not so, and these guys do it perfectly) Basically you can't go wrong.  Can get crowded (there's only like 5 tables) but get it to go and watch others drool over your lunch.  One of the best sandwiches I've had in a while."
1122,0,4.0,1,2007-09-24,"After a lengthy debate with my local hosts about where to dine for lunch, after ruling out a relatively local place known for it's Mediterranean style food and especially its lemon chicken orzo soup, it was settled that we'd go to a different spot because it had rockin' sandwiches. Along for the ride, I said, hey, why not?  You're the boss.  (A figure of speech.  Literally.) So, imagine my confusion when we sit down and the first thing I see is a bunch of lamb entrees and a lemon chicken orzo soup.  WTF?!  I'm so confused. Well, it just so happens that this place Snack is an annex of some sort to the other place we were considering, even though no one knew it when we were debating.  What are the odds?  I mean, I'm in the biggest eating city in the world, and my two compatriots are essentially debating the merits of the same place??? The lamb sandwich was amazing.  What is it about lamb in NYC right now?  Two times in like 14 hours.  And the soup was very refreshing and flavorful. This is a super cute little spot with seating for no more than about 15 people, so be prepared to wait if you're there during prime time. Oh, and the minty fresh lemonade hit the spot on this warm day, too. (OK, so Russ already told the story, but I like my version better. Ha.)"
1123,0,4.0,1,2007-09-18,"I went here for lunch the other day with a coworker and it was great.  I had the chicken sandwich (chicken, tomatoes, roasted red onions, spicy mint lemonaise, arugula and mint), which may be the best damn chicken sandwich I've had.  My coworker seemed very pleased with his Greek salad/meat pie-ish thing.  The items on the menu largely consist of your more popular Greek choices (spanakopita, pastitsio, etc.) and are all very reasonably priced.  It's a very small place (maybe about 10 seats) and while it wasn't crowded when we got there, it was definitely getting there when we left.  I can understand why."
1124,0,5.0,1,2007-09-14,"I lived on spring street for 3 years, basically around the corner from Snack. In that time I developed a strong addiction to snack's chicken sandwich on the lunch menu (among other menu items, but the chicken sandwich was my fave). I was getting snack delivery at least once a week and the delivery guy and I became very close (kidding). Anyways, what I am getting at is that I like this place. You should go."
1125,0,5.0,1,2007-05-16,"I squeezed into this place seeking something healthy and hearty for lunch.  I noticed a ""specials"" chalkboard with chicken and roasted vegetable salad scribbled on it and decided to give it a shot. I sat on the benches outside and waited.  After a little while I was presented with a little white box that I couldn't wait to open once I got back to the office. .....Wow! A moist chicken breast section, surrounded by roasted tomatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, onions and mushrooms with lettuce and baby mixed greens accompanied by two delicious and large feta croutons and great dressing.   The best salad I've had recently.  I definitely will be paying them another visit."
1126,0,4.0,1,2007-05-09,"Ever since I studied in Greece, I have always looked for a decent Greek place no matter where I happen to be traveling. Now that I live in NYC, I had been pretty disappointed in terms of finding a quick, tasty and legitimate Greek menu. Sure, you could go to Thalassa or the like to have a real sit-down meal, but what about the quick occasions that you need something hearty and fast? Greek usually perfectly fits the bill, but I hadn't had much luck in the city until this place. Cozy little space with a very legit Greek menu, with all the favorites: moussaka, souvlaki, spanikopita, baklava and even a couple of Greek beers (though no Mythos, my hands-down favorite). Went there 2 days in a row after I discovered it, and been pleased both times. I particularly recommend the garlic potato puree with pita and the warm chicken pie with mushrooms for lunch, and the deliciious eggplant stuffed with ground sirloin and bechemel sauce for dinner, though it is a special. The baklava serving size is HUGE and it is really very good, certainly comparable with some of the best homecooked stuff I've had. All in all, very dependable and authentic Greek cooking, reasonable prices, good service and good atmosphere. Certainly worth checking out, whether you need a quick snack while wandering SoHo or want to come out for a casual but romantic dinner."
1127,0,4.0,1,2007-03-07,"i've only tried the sandwiches here, and the hummus (mmmm). everything tastes fresh, light but filling, and actually healthy! the sandwich bread is a bit crunchy and not as soft as most breads but it doesnt leave that soft bread gunk stuck in your teeth feeling, which i hated back when i wore braces. minus one star because there are only 5 two-seater tables so most of the times i came here, they were already taken.  a perfect cozy place for you to go alone as well. i love coming here in the beginning of summer. it's a great stop on a shopping excursion in soho."
1128,0,5.0,1,2007-01-30,"I live for this place.  It feeds me lunch at least twice a week, and never once has it let me down.  A few highlights: the lamb sandwich; the artichoke/chicken salad; any variation of the pikilia (three cold mezes).  Everything is fresh, staff are friendly, and the food is without rival.  These kinds of places make food in New York the best!"
1129,0,5.0,1,2007-01-24,"I Snack on a weekly basis and it's always the same: spinach pie with a side of eggplant mush. Then a squidgen of lemon followed by a ""don't bother me, I'm eating"". Round off the experience with a handful of jordan almonds. Truly one of the best meals in soho."
1130,0,5.0,1,2006-08-14,"Snack is the happy tasty, the warm and wonderful, a delicious restaurant with lots of vegetarian options. Less abstractly, it's a tiny, tin-ceilinged, ten-seater Greek restaurant,  with a great menu of mezze -- think of it less as a gyro stand, and more as an upscale but homey small plates restaurant. I wish I remembered the names of the dishes better, but there was a cheese and tomato salad that was wonderful; a white bean spread that was savory and delicious, and stuffed peppers as well. It's great for lunch while shopping, but would also be good for a date... though you'd run the risk of your date falling in love with the Baklava."
1131,0,5.0,1,2005-09-21,"Their spinach triangles cannot be beat. The Greek salad is also wonderful. If it's hot out, don't miss the mint lemonade. On a sunny day, have the folks at Snack pack your lunch to go and sit at one of the tables in the nearby park. UPDATE 1/2007: Don't miss the pastitsio!"
1132,0,4.0,1,2005-04-21,"Cozy little Greek place.  Love the meze!  Highly recommend the skordalia (potato garlic puree) and the tzatziki (cucumber yogurt dip).  They also have all the traditional dishes when you think of Greek food - spanakopitakia, spinach pie, pastitsio and mousaka.  Don't forget the Greek desserts - yogurt (with honey, of course), halva and baklava."
1133,1,1.0,-1,2013-12-21,"My wife and I took my parents there for lunch and were greeted by stares from the staff with no greeting whatsoever despite there being only five people in the entire place. This was followed by a rude, abrupt waitress who acted like we had to speed talk to place an order. To cap off this wonderful experience, the pizza was non descript and  the pasta tasted like it had been ordered from a diner. So poor, in fact, that my two kids, who normally love pasta, refused to eat theirs. Won't be back and will definitely not recommend this place to anyone."
1134,1,1.0,-1,2013-11-25,Got a margarita pizza. First off let me say very expensive that one pie came out to 25$ with 2 simple toppings on it. Secondly the was a piece of hair in it.  Also the sauce was bland. My table was all oily. Definitely not recommending this place might as well go down the block to Tommys. Again HORRIBLE.
1135,1,2.0,-1,2014-07-24,"The food is average pizzeria and not cheap.  Add that to the fact that I puked my guts out in the bathroom during the ""meal"" and I've decided not to go back."
1136,1,2.0,-1,2014-03-05,"I can not fathom why people would give this restaurant more than a star or two. I'm starting to find Yelp reviews unreliable. This was our first time ordering from Peppino's and we will never eat their food again. Overpriced for the quality. I gave one star for prompt delivery and one star because the food wasn't horrible. It was just bad. Their bread is tasteless- this goes for their crust and garlic crisps. No flavor whatsoever. Same with the plain pizza. We couldn't even finish a slice. The marina sauce is coated with a layer of oil and tastes burnt. The penne a'la vodka was fine, but again, lacked flavor. The eggplant parm roll tasted old. If you want good pizza on 5th Ave go to Brooklyn Central or La Villa, which also has amazing pasta and appetizers."
1137,1,3.0,-1,2014-11-21,"Went here during the time it was busy and i got a regular slice. When i received it, it was just warm.... i rather have my pizza hot, but maybe its just because it was busy but still..."
1138,1,3.0,-1,2014-09-29,"never lets me down!!!!!! If you order a lot you can def. rack up a bill but let me tell you it is worth it! I would just like waitresses that are little  more ""with it"". Other than that.. the BEST pizza ever!!!"
1139,1,3.0,-1,2010-02-12,"Pizza was not bad, however not great either. Prices are reasonable.  I think they can work on there service."
1140,1,3.0,-1,2009-12-05,"Peppinos is far superior to your typical neighborhood slice shop but it isn't a destination pizza place. The staff is friendly to a fault, which almost makes up for the errors in their food. 2 out of the last 3 times that I've ordered pies from them, they have put the wrong toppings on the pies. I'm not a picky guy but it is annoying when you are paying $20 + for a pizza. I'm not sure what the issue is but I hope they get it fixed. Delivery service is inconsistent in delivery time (15-45 minutes) but the food does arrive hot every time. In addition to their pies their salads and sandwiches are also delicious, especially the pepperoni hero."
1141,1,4.0,-1,2014-12-06,Solid place good pizza
1142,1,4.0,-1,2014-10-10,"I am impressed with this place. I love pizza, but Solid oven pizza was my frist time to try. Amazing and delicious. It 's one of my best pizza experience of NYC! I can't wait to go back for more. (after I missed NYC's Biggest Pizza Party)"
1143,1,4.0,-1,2013-06-08,"Cute little spot very old school feeling. Theyve got brick oven pizza which is always a plus. But if your not ordering a whole pie sometimes the pizzas hit or miss. The bruschetta, the diavolo, these are not. they are always spot on and delicious. get a pizza as an app for the table if youve got a group and then chow down on their actual dishes. good stuff."
1144,1,4.0,-1,2013-05-28,This restaurant helped me planned a last-minute birthday party for my daughter after another place cancelled at the last minute. Pizza was crisp and delicious and the waitstaff were patient with a room full of 9 y/o's. It's not fancy or gourmet; it's just honest pizza and god service at a fair price.
1145,1,4.0,-1,2013-02-27,The quattro stagioni reminds me of great pizzas from my childhood. I highly recommend this place for delivery.
1146,1,4.0,-1,2011-12-13,"I order from this place at least twice a week. There ceaser salad is great!!!, comes with amazing garlic crisps which are so yummy! I come here frequently for dinner also with my 2 kids & they are very accommodating! No weird faces when you have to seat a stroller & a highchair! Thx for your good food & good manners!"
1147,1,4.0,-1,2011-02-17,Wonderfully delicious pizza! One of my favorite places to go in Brooklyn.
1148,1,4.0,-1,2010-06-09,Pretty good cheesesteak subs. Pizza from a brick oven: a plus. Good service too.
1149,1,4.0,-1,2009-02-17,Nice atmosphere and good service. They have a great menu for everyone. Crispy pizza and good taste.
1150,1,5.0,-1,2014-12-09,"Amazing food! I went with a friend and had one of their daily specials with seafood and red sauce. It was out of this world. The portion lasted me for the next day's lunch. Nice, friendly stuff. Overall good experience. Will go back and would recommend it to friends."
1151,1,5.0,-1,2014-10-02,"Peppinos surprised me quite a bit. I wasn't sure what to think of the place when I first walked in but the atmosphere was warm and inviting. I sat down and had a Margarita Pie and it was to die for! Just the correct amount of sauce to cheese ratio, it came to our table piping hot and the sauce wasn't overly sweet which is a pet peeve of mine. I can't wait to go back and try some of the steak sandwiches, I hear they're great!"
1152,1,5.0,-1,2014-09-21,Manager was extra helpful and friendly. Food was delicious. Place was nice and clean.
1153,1,5.0,-1,2014-07-11,Great pizza! My go to place when I want something that hits the spot. They use all fresh ingredients and they are very generous with their pizza topping . Def check them out if you haven't already .. You won't be disappointed
1154,1,5.0,-1,2014-04-20,Pricey but great Italian food! Best around!
1155,1,5.0,-1,2013-12-26,"This probably one of my top 10 favorite restaurants! I order the ravioli and it was amazing! The marina sauce was the best, Homemade and delicious. Though I recommend coming in hungry because it fills you up and portion are kinda big. It was a like I was in Italy and the atmosphere is very laid back.   Definitely A must if your visiting New York!"
1156,1,5.0,-1,2013-10-16,"Great place, great food. I have in both Brooklyn locations and have almost enjoy a good meal."
1157,1,5.0,-1,2013-06-25,"I rarely comment about my experiences at restaurants but needed to take the time to thank Peppinos for the truly amazing food and excellent service!!!!  The Bruschetta is a must have so so yummy {trust me}.  My main meal of Penne a la vodka was unforgettable.  My Hunny had the Philly Cheese Steak which of course I needed to try, it was incredible, needless to say no more driving to Philadelphia for us.  Pricing is excellent for the amount of food that is served!  If I could give a 10 star rating they would get it for sure.  On another note we were at the restaurant when that musician came into the restaurant.  What an unprofessional jerk!  Yes the manager was trying to find out what was going on in the middle of dinner service making tons of calls and trying not to let it affect the patrons.  Kiddos to Peppinos for not allowing the musician to play and standing their ground.  I ENJOY the family restaurant values!  WE WILL BE BACK OFTEN!"
1158,1,5.0,-1,2013-04-20,Both spots are great I believe there's one in Park Slope and one in Bay ridge. Both places make great brick oven pizza. Def got my stamp of approval 5 star! all day every day. Margherita pizza is really good at Peppinos you will savor every bite. They even deliver pretty far. So if your in the Ft Greene area and your in the mood for some pizza give these guys a call.
1159,1,5.0,-1,2013-03-14,Enjoyed the pizza . Very fresh and flavorful. Worth the wait.
1160,1,5.0,-1,2012-11-21,"My husband and I visit Peppinos once a week and always enjoy the food.  I just wanted to let everyone know what type of people they are.  I know a neighborhood girl that married and moved to Breezy Point to raise her 5 children and has recently been displaced because of Hurricane Sandy.  When I mentioned it to one of the owners of Peppinos they immediately invited the intire family for dinner on them.  These are real family, neighborhood people ! God Bless them for doing such a good thing!"
1161,1,5.0,-1,2012-06-26,I think it is a family run business which makes it even better in my book. The pizza is fantastic here and the service is always great. The vodka sauce and garlic crisps are real good too!
1162,1,5.0,-1,2012-04-22,"Let me start with I've only every had their delivery... that being said, they're super fast, super nice, and super DELICIOUS!  The vodka pie is honestly amazing.  A little too good, like, ""I'm already really full, but I should probably have just one more slice,"" good.  A large isn't a ""huge"" pie, but with how good it is take that as a saving grace!  I definitely recommend :)"
1163,1,5.0,-1,2012-01-14,"This place is pretty close to perfect.  Amazing brick oven, wood fired pizza, incredible heros made with homemade, amazing dough.  Sauce is fresh, barely touched using great products.  Incredibly warm and nice staff both in person and on the phone.  This isn't a complaint but a request.... I wish they had a few more appetizer choices, i think they could do a really good fried mozzarella app, fried calamari, maybe an arancine? I also wish they would make a clam pizza which when done well by great pizza restaurants is absolutely amazing.   I just feel like they would do everything well and this would be great.  Keep it up Peppinos, you guys are great in every way."
1164,1,5.0,-1,2011-08-31,"Okay, here It is. Went to Grimaldi's and the line was way too long. Yelped a few places and found reviews for  Peppino's. Read a review about the place and decided to take my party of five to Park Slope. WOW. We started with bruschette and a mozzarella appetizer. Then we got some pizzas and pastas. Vodka and margerita pie were amazing. Fusilli were amazing and i really enjoyed the orecciette pasta dish. All the food was tasty and the service was great. I would highly reccomend this place, quality food at the rite price. Peppino's is my new spot."
1165,1,5.0,-1,2011-08-15,"We have lived in Park Slope for three years and only now FINALLY have found a pizza place we love. Since we live about 14 blocks away, I hadn't realized they would deliver to us, but it was no problem. We ordered six large pizzas for a party (Margheritas and Diavolas), and the staff was incredibly friendly, responsive and right on time. Sometimes delivered pizza isn't so good, but this was still hot and just perfect. They were quick. I thought maybe I had ordered too much, but that definitely wasn't the case - everyone loved it. Will definitely order again and maybe trek over to eat at the restaurant, too."
1166,1,5.0,-1,2011-06-22,Best pizza in the slope. There thin crust margherita pizza is delicious. The crust is crunchy and the sauce is perfect. A few slaps of fresh mozzarella and you have a great pie of pizza. It can be a bit pricey compared to some other pizzerias but you pay for quality so I don't mind not one bit.
1167,1,5.0,-1,2011-04-18,"My husband has a love for brick oven pizza and when we found Peppino's on a weekend stroll through Park Slope he was in heaven. We ordered the Margherita pie well done (I don't like a soggy center) with extra fresh basil and it was DELICIOUS!  The crust was perfect not too thick or too thin, the sauce was flavorful and there was just enough fresh mozzarella that you didn't feel guilty eating a slice or the whole pie, which we did :)  The staff is very accomodating and attentive.  We've made it our Saturday lunch spot and can't wait to try out all the other items on their menu.  Happy Eating!"
1168,1,5.0,-1,2011-04-08,"Seriously.  I want to sew my *** shut so it would never leave me.  This place has the best pizza ever.  It's a weekly favorite at my apartment!  I've only had delivery, never been there.... but wow!  Get a large pie with peperoni, ham, sausage and mushroom.  Mmmm"
1169,1,5.0,-1,2011-01-23,Best Pizza in Brooklyn. I tried others and I have to say that they don't even come close. Cheesesteaks are great and the pasta dishes are real deal. Love this place.
1170,1,5.0,-1,2010-08-30,"Quite simply, the most delicious pizza you'll get in the slope. Whether a slice or a pie, it's an amazing taste sensation to rock your world!"
1171,1,5.0,-1,2010-05-18,"I moved about a block away from Peppino's, and it quickly became my go to place for when I want a tasty margherita pizza.  The atmosphere is comfortable inside, the waitstaff (er, waitress - it's been the same woman every time I've been) is incredibly nice, and the bruschetta is to die for.  Seriously - my wife (a phenomenal cook) has been trying to replicate it at home, but something about the bread is hard to pin down. I recommend that you get a Caesar salad, a small margherita pizza, and the bruschetta to share if there are two of you and you're particularly hungry.   Also, if you want to split the salad, they go ahead and put it into two bowls for you.  How cool is that for the down the street pizza joint?"
1172,1,5.0,-1,2010-04-05,"WOW. I love the Margaretta pizza!, Thin crust crunchy, full of flavor its amazing but it doesn't end there. The past dishes are amazing, and the best thing about it is you can order specials and they will make it for you. The fish specials and the Baked clams are full of flavor and SO FRESH. When i walked into this place i was expecting a pizzeria what i got was a full on Italian gourmet restaurant... Its very cute and family oriented. The Pizza is amazing, original Margareta is the Best, and if you want something different i suggest you should try the Arugula Pizza! The Pasta is Fantastic. The sandwiches are amazing, esp the grilled chicken fresh mozzarella roasted peppers and balsamic vinegar.. Mouth Watering! The appetizers are amazing.Try the Baked Clams or the Bruschetta I am without question and beyond doubt a Fan For LIFE!!"
1173,1,5.0,-1,2009-11-18,"Best Margherita pizza I've tasted ever, anywhere.  The crust is thin and oven crisp, the mozzarella is fresh and delicious, and there are fresh basil leaves baked right on top.  Too delicious!  Fast local delivery too."
1174,1,5.0,-1,2008-08-09,Wow!!!! I was thoroughly surprised about this restaurant. The Penne a la Vodka was out of this world. I hear they have another restaurant in Bay Ridge. Wish there was one on every corner.
1175,1,5.0,1,2014-12-24,"Excellent pizza, really friendly neighborhood place. Very generous portions for salad and pasta too -- and never a long wait for a table."
1176,1,4.0,1,2014-12-21,"Ate here last night, was able to get seated around 7pm immediately (there were 4 of us). I had a cappuccino with whipped cream and cinnamon which was delicious and warmed me up right away. The pizza was delicious as well! I forget the names, but I ordered a pizza with mushrooms, olives, ham, and artichokes - YUM! The crust was crunchy and I loved how I could really taste the smokey-ness from the brick oven. Would definitely come back/order takeout from them again!"
1177,1,5.0,1,2014-12-08,Delicious food and great customer service! Will definitely return. We love getting the margarita pie with pepperoni and the kids love the penne vodka with chicken. Love this place. Top pizza joint in NYC.
1178,1,3.0,1,2014-12-07,"Good, not great. The pizza chef that deigns to use canned mushrooms commits the pinnacle of pizza heresy. Especially at $24.95 for a small (enough for two and leftovers), I expect someone to forage for even the most basic button 'shroom. Mellow about mushrooms, I am not. Other tasting notes: great crust, sauce on the watery side, quality sausage"
1179,1,5.0,1,2014-11-21,"Wonderfully authentic brick oven pizza. Nothing pretentious about this place. Great pizza, great staff, great experience. I wish more places got it like this place gets it. Best pizza in the neighborhood, but would be worth going the extra mile to get here if I didn't leave here."
1180,1,5.0,1,2014-11-16,"We get plain pizza most of the time, half with pepperoni. My wife is very picky when it comes to pizza and she's obsessed with how great a pie is. I'm also really into their eggplant rolls - probably the best I've ever had. If the pricing scares you away, I suggest making the splurge. Totally worth it."
1181,1,5.0,1,2014-10-28,We love this pizza! Always delicious!!
1182,1,5.0,1,2014-10-26,The Diavola pizza was absolutely amazing and the service superb. I will definitely make this my new local regular pizza spot.
1183,1,5.0,1,2014-10-24,"Much needed review, this place is another awesome brick oven pizza place, good for a couple, or a sunday treat..fresh, yummy and  the food presentation is classy ,service good,would recommend."
1184,1,5.0,1,2014-10-22,Yelp did not lead me astray on this recommendation. The small pizza is huge. We did ours half and half - prosciutto & the blanca. Both were so good and totally what you want when you think NY pizza.
1185,1,5.0,1,2014-10-20,"Came up to Brooklyn for the day to see a show, afterwards I just wanted somewhere quick, not too crowded, and that had beer available. Used Yelp to find this pizza joint. When we got there we ordered a round of drinks and a large Diavola. Took less than fifteen minutes for the pie to come out.  The pie itself was awesome, I didn't want to stop eating it. I was actually almost tempted to order another pie to take home! The staff also was quick and really friendly. Thumbs up to Peppino's!"
1186,1,5.0,1,2014-09-28,"This place serves the best good basic pizza in Park Slope. If you want a fancy pizza, go to Franny's but if you want good solid basic pizza, Peppino's is where you want to be."
1187,1,5.0,1,2014-09-19,"WOW.  We looked at restaurants on our GPS under Italian and this came up.  Walked in the smell would bring you to your knees.  PLUS they were playing Italian Opera. My boss said if it is half as good as it smells we are in for a treat.  Well it was better than that.  My boss is a pro with Philly steaks and Philly Hoagies and he had one that he said was a HOMERUN!  One of the best he has had. Italian food is my most favorite and I had Penne Alla Boscaiola.   OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I have eaten in the ""little Italy's"" in Boston, New York, Scotland, San Francisco, Minneapolis MN to name a few.  The food quality was 5 Diamonds that all I can say.  I will make plans whenever I am NEAR this place to go in and try other items.  Our tiny waitress with her cool black glasses (Tanya???) I do not remember was personable and just so funny about her restaurant. Try it you cannot lose!"
1188,1,4.0,1,2014-09-14,I've never eaten at their storefront but I have ordered from them a lot and still do if I'm  in the area. I'm not a big fan of brick oven pizza and never really had theirs so I can't really comment on the pizza but everything else they make from their heroes and rolls to the their pastas and salads are all on point. Their Philly cheese steaks are a bit salty but still among the  best I've ever had in Brooklyn.
1189,1,3.0,1,2014-09-14,"I wish I could give this 3.5 stars, but I don't think it deserves 4. Good if not too acidic pizza. Everything else a little too rough around the edges. Very nice and attentive staff, they were very accommodating when we asked to exchange our dessert which was inedible (old and freezer burnt tasting amaretto ice cream)."
1190,1,5.0,1,2014-09-13,Amazing brick oven pizza!! My gf & I tried it for the first time tonight and were blown away!! Definitely coming here again.
1191,1,5.0,1,2014-09-10,"Been here 100 times and it's always been delicious. I'm pretty sure I've tried everything on their menu and it's consistently good. I've been here for lunch, dinner, and events and the staff never disappoints me. If you go make sure you try their margherita pie and one of their cheese steak specials. You will be glad you did. Oh and just a random addition: I'm COMPLETELY obsessed with their muscles in red sauce. I get a tray every year for Christmas Eve and my family goes nuts over it!"
1192,1,4.0,1,2014-09-09,"There are a bunch of Italian restaurants in Park Slope.  I honestly like to avoid them because of the carbs, so coming here was just out of spontaneity.  My mate had the garlic bread - even though there was already complimentary (nice and warm!) bread.  Pizza dough slices were nice and toasty - though could use a touch more garlic.  The sausage pasta alfredo was super yummy - though it sort of turns a bit into a greasy mess the next day (leftovers).  Would be back if I ever have a carb hankering.  Winter would be nice - as the oven is right next to the bathroom, super toasty!"
1193,1,5.0,1,2014-08-17,"Just had dinner at Peppino's.  We had spaghetti with meatballs - a huge heaping tasty platter and the make your own pizza (sweet italian sausage + mushrooms + pepperoni + onions) on a wheat crust.  The pizza came out on the regular non-wheat crust but the owner/manager came out and apologized for the error and made up for it by making us another pie, same toppings, with wheat crust at no extra charge.  We appreciated the excellent food, excellent service and the way they go the extra mile to make sure the customers are happy.  Authentic Italian food with excellent service and a great atmosphere."
1194,1,5.0,1,2014-08-02,"Peppino's is a very solid neighborhood family friendly pizza restaurant. We usually get the margarita pizza, which is fantastic with very fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. The servers are extremely friendly, and the pizza and sandwiches are just all great. The service, variety on the menu, and non existent lines (most of the time) make this place a go to for me and my girlfriend. I highly recommend this place!"
1195,1,3.0,1,2014-07-29,First let me say the food is great. This is the 2nd time we were here both times the food had been great but the 2nd time the service was not good at all. We ordered a pizza ($27.00) - the black olives when the order came we had black olives on the pizza. If I am going to pay that much for a pizza at least get my order right.. We did not want to wait so we picked them off. I was expecting at least something off the pizza but no we almost did not even get a sorry. I also ordered a kids past for my boys to split it was $16.00 a little much for a kids order of pasta. We enjoyed the food but were not happy with the service or the price.
1196,1,4.0,1,2014-07-27,"Great service and great food.  Lost a star due to hot, hot, hot bathroom with only scalding hot water out of sink.  Cold faucet is burning, burning hot!  I guess that's what happens when the bathroom is next to a wood cooking stove? Great food and great service though.  Would happily return!"
1197,1,5.0,1,2014-07-26,"The pizza is GREAT! And the service is BETTER! We ate a cheese pizza I can say every part of the pizza was on point. The crust,the pie, and the toppings were all fresh! Next time I come to Brooklyn this is the place that will have my business!"
1198,1,5.0,1,2014-07-25,"Excellent pizza, was walking by and the recession special caught my eye, but the yelp reviews drew me in; the service and ultimately execution knocked it out of the park. The first time was just the recession special, an amazing deal at 5 and change for two slices and a fountain soda. What sealed it was ordering delivery had two large pies one plain and one pepperoni and the quoted delivery time was 30-45, however the pizza was here between 20-30 minutes. At the end of the day, the brick oven taste is the lasting memory but the attention to detail leaves you wanting more. As for the taste, I'm one for a million toppings on my pizza and i still prefer the plain."
1199,1,5.0,1,2014-07-19,"This place is amazing I really loved their appetizers specially the backed muscles abd the mozzarella basil salad, and the shrimp there is really good as well one of the places I really loved their food in New York."
1200,1,4.0,1,2014-07-14,"really good pizza, for a really good price."
1201,1,4.0,1,2014-07-06,"Great pizza with a fresh and crispy crust and wide variety of toppings. Definitely the best pizza in the area. The delivery is a bit spotty but I think that is mostly due to my ordering at high volume times. In addition, the owner, or maybe the manager on duty, called as a follow up to ensure my satisfaction with the order. I highly appreciate this kind of service, which is also present in the restaurant itself. The young wait staff is well trained and very accommodating. I look forward to many more meals in the family friendly neighborhood spot."
1202,1,5.0,1,2014-06-28,"This place makes an amazing pizza pie.  Perfect crispness, tangy sauce, fresh mozzarella that doesn't make the pie damp, and the perfect amount of fresh basil.  Our 6 & 7 year old nieces loved it too."
1203,1,4.0,1,2014-06-16,"I walk by this place every day and after a friend nominated it the best pizza in Park Slope, I felt compelled to try it. My boyfriend and I went here a few nights ago and had the bruschetta as an appetizer and a small half-pepperoni and cheese (his half) and half-pizza a la vodka (mine!) We were impressed! The bruschetta was fresh, full of onions and garlic (yum!). The pizza came out fairly quickly and I am definitely a fan of their brick oven style. The small pizza was more than enough for the two of us, especially after the appetizer. My boyfriend loved his little crispy pepperonis, and I loved the more bold flavors of my half. We each had a slice to take home to enjoy the next day. Our server was friendly and everything went smoothly! The restaurant itself is cute and casual, I would definitely come back when I'm in the mood for some good pizza."
1204,1,4.0,1,2014-06-08,"Here's another place I wish I had tried sooner, I mean it is in my neighborhood!  I guess I always just ignored it because it replaced the beloved ""Aniello's"" pizzeria that was in the neighborhood for years and had become well known with the old school locals. But shame on me. In the mood for Italian but not wanting to stray to far, we went to check it out. Nice place and the food smelled fantastic as soon as you walk in. The waitresses were really nice and never made you feel awkward.  We decided on the mixed salad, spaghetti and meatballs and the puttanesca pizza. The salad was delicious.  romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, peppers, onions, olives, oil & balsamic vinegar. Tangy, fresh and very yummy. I must have it again. The spaghetti and meatballs were also very good. The meatballs tasted fresh and homemade. The pizza, which I loveeee! tomato sauce, capers, black olives, anchovies, oregano & fresh mozzarella. Delicious thin crust, made in a brick oven, which had a little salt and tang from the anchovies and olives, and the cheese melted so it was nice and crisp! They make pizza just the way I like!. I maybe could have done without the anchovies since I'm not a big fan, but it was nice for trying something new. And I believe they were not black olives but Kalamata,  which I don't have no problem with! I am 100% going back here! Love it!"
1205,1,5.0,1,2014-05-25,One of the best pizza and Philly cheesesteak I ever had! I order delivery and it was quick! I would be ordering from here from now on :)!!
1206,1,4.0,1,2014-05-13,Big Fan!  love the pizza here! Staff is super nice.
1207,1,4.0,1,2014-05-03,"We ate here this evening with 4 adults and 2 kids ( 10 year old and 14 year old). We had pizza and two salads. I ordered the Tuna Salad which was made with high quality Italian (olive oil) Tuna. All the ingredients were fresh and the salad was delicious. The kids are living in Massachusetts and love ""New York PIzza.""  and they were impressed as were the adults. Towards the end of the meal a manager or possible owner noticed the crust of the pizza in my husband's hand which was on  a path to his mouth. Keep in mind that all the adults had slices and we had no complaints. The Lady offered to make us another pizza because she felt that this dark crust was too dark to meet their standards. We explained that we had no complaints and appreciated the offer but we were really to full to eat it. Then she said she would take it off the bill. The food was above average but the attention paid to customer satisfaction in this place is extraordinary."
1208,1,5.0,1,2014-05-03,Very nice simple and cozy place! They provide an amazing service. The Margarita pizza was soooo good: juicy and crispy. Tip: you get free soda refills which is really pleasant. :) love it! Thank you!
1209,1,5.0,1,2014-05-03,"Great Pizza Big servings Our waitress was super nice Free soda refills Simple, but excellent! Will Definitely come back."
1210,1,5.0,1,2014-05-02,"Peppino's isn't on any of those ""best pie"" lists for NYC, but I'm not quite sure why.  The pizza is great and significantly cheaper than their competitors.  The staff are very helpful and social, and you don't have the crazy wait like you do at Paulie Gee's, Roberta's, Motorino, etc.  We made a trip out to Park Slope to try this place, and I'm glad we did.  I will absolutely be visiting again!"
1211,1,5.0,1,2014-04-30,This place is amazing. The good rocks the service is stellar and I'll be coming back time and time again. If you're looking for a great Italian restaurant in Park slope this is the place to go to. Highly recommended!!!
1212,1,5.0,1,2014-04-28,My boyfriend and I take out from here. It's so delicious!!!!
1213,1,5.0,1,2014-04-27,"Absolutely LOVE Peppino's!!! Walk in and you're greeted by an eclectic decor in honor of all things brooklyn/ Italian. What makes this place great? -1. Delicious food! You can't go wrong with ANYTHING! I promise you. From the pizzas to the seafood to the calzones, it's all melt in your mouth deliciousness. 2.  FANTASTIC customer service. Wow! My family has been dining here for 5+ years and we have never ever had a bad experience. Because it's a family run business you can't help but feel part of the family. On the fence? Just try it out. It's worth every penny!"
1214,1,5.0,1,2014-04-24,Great food great service.  I always have the margarita pizza. Cesar salad  with perino beer.  It's like heaven.   Price us up there but worth the ingredients they use. It is not a tourist trap pizzeria
1215,1,5.0,1,2014-04-14,I am blessed to have Peppino's be my go to delivery pizza. To have a pie of such high caliber brought to my door is always a surprise.
1216,1,4.0,1,2014-04-12,"This place is fabulous. It's got a really classic, homey vibe (brick walls, kids' letters or drawings on the walls) and they serve a bunch of dishes with a wide price range. My fiance and I shared the veggie pizza and a bowl of garlic bread (basically pizza crusts with garlic and marinara sauce). The pizza was really good, the wine was good, the crusts slathered in oil and garlic were (obviously) good. There was definitely a substantial amount of noise coming from all the kids and families, but it sort-of just added to the laid-back atmosphere of the place. The family sitting at the next table dropped their whole pie onto the floor and the waitress assured them they could have another, on the house. That's a clear sign they want returning customers. Our waitress was very nice and since the place wasn't packed we were checked on about every thirty seconds (I think she was bored and wanted to chat). The only reason I took off one star is because I'm a vegetarian and I wish they had another veggie pizza option with ""meatier"" veggies (eggplant, artichokes, etc)."
1217,1,5.0,1,2014-04-09,"Growing up on 10th Street in Park Slope, Brooklyn we had several outstanding Pizzeria's to choose from. So when taking my daughter and her fiance on a pizza quest I naturally had to stop in my old neighborhood and sample a slice from Anellio's, which wasn't there anymore. Instead Peppino's Brick Oven Pizzeria now occupies the location. I quickly looked up the comments on Yelp and saw that it was rated very high. Inside did not resemble anything from the old business. It does not resemble the familiar take style counter near the entrance, but rather a sit down set up. The Brick oven is now in the back in plane sight. We were greeted by a hostess and opted to take the Pizza to go. We ordered the Margarita with Meatballs. We sat at a table while we waited the the young girl brought us to go cups of water. Very nice touch. Within a few minutes our Pizza was ready. Brick ovens do cook very quickly. The Pizza looked and tasted fantastic. Sauce was sweet and fresh, the Mozzarella was fresh not the commercial shredded type, the meatballs were sliced homemade. The crust was thin, but not too thin. Not burned as most brick oven pizza can be. Texture of the crust was light, not chewy, with just the right amount of pull as you bite. Overall and excellent PIE. Good Service. My neighborhood still Rocks Great Pizza!"
1218,1,5.0,1,2014-04-06,One of the best pizza places in Brooklyn. Also they have a fish salad and lentil soup that is incredible. The bread is always fresh and are always happy to get you more. Small casual place but the food is always great.
1219,1,5.0,1,2014-03-23,"My wife and I just ordered from here tonight, looking for a good pizza place in Park Slope. We've tried a few in and around the South Slope area - Smiley's, Pizza Plus, Enzo's, etc... - and Peppino's is far and away the best. We were told delivery would be 45 minutes, and our order arrived a shade under 25. A large, coal-fired pepperoni reminiscent of those you see at Juliana's, Roberta's, and Grimaldi's, and it was fantastic. Light, chewy crust, slightly spicy meat, flavorful sauce. It looks like we have found our local."
1220,1,5.0,1,2014-03-21,"I had the best margarita pizza ever here.  The fresh mozzarella is wonderful, and their tomato sauce is amazing."
1221,1,4.0,1,2014-03-20,two slices with fresh cooked sausages very good
1222,1,3.0,1,2014-03-12,"Fast delivery, pretty good pizza (half margherita half puttanesca) I like more crunchy crust and this was not enough. I might try it again, eating in the pizzeria, because delivery is not for sure the best if you want crunchy staff... This time I was too hungry but next time I will make it crunchier warming it up on a non sticking flat pan."
1223,1,5.0,1,2014-02-15,"Really great pizza, and very nice family-vibe staff. Have ordered take out a bunch of times. Once when my girlfriend had called the wrong location by mistake for our pick up order, they apologized as though it was their mistake and sat me down with a complimentary glass of wine to wait for my order to be done. That's how you do it!"
1224,1,5.0,1,2014-02-06,Came here yesterday after I went to the gym. I was hungry and needed some good pizza so I turned to yelp. This place showed good reviews and the outside looked nice and clean so I gave it a shot. I ordered a small regular pie and it was so good I ate it all myself. Although I was very full it was worth every drop. It has a crispy crust the sauce is just right and the cheese isn't cheap. If your passing by stop in cause it's worth it. Great cozy ambiance inside a little nicer then a typical pizza joint.
1225,1,5.0,1,2014-02-03,"So a friend is over my somewhat secluded spot in Gowanus and rather than peruse 4th/5th ave for a place to eat they ask me ""What's good around here?"", that's when I don't even think, like a math equation I just say ""You should get Peppino's."" And usually they get Peppino's. It was the first meal I had when I moved to Gowanus and I won't have to look anywhere else for pizza. As long as I am ordering a pie it will be from Peppino's(I say pie because I'm not sure if they have slices).  It is so authentic, like the pies I've had in Italy. Fresh mozzarella, crispy crust that's chewy but also has a slight char. The sauce uses good tomatoes and has texture, it is also well seasoned. I've dined in and ordered out -- consistency is the same. Check this place out for italian fare if you are in the area and you definitely will not be disappointed. They have great customer service too, I'm pretty sure it is family owned and operated and from the waitress to the manager they all treat patrons like they are invested in the restaurant and it's success."
1226,1,5.0,1,2014-01-24,"My foodie troupe and I usually choose trendy Manhattan spots, but when I suggested coming to my apartment in Brooklyn (the horror!), we wanted to keep dinner easy and nearby. We meandered down 5th Avenue to Peppino's - recommended to me in passing by a local friend. The space reminds me a lot of a restaurant that I'd find in my farmerville hometown in PA. No bells and whistles. Plastic tablecloths. High school wait staff. FANTASTIC pizza. Cheap bill. Perfect!"
1227,1,2.0,1,2014-01-12,I was expecting better pizza after reading the reviews. Kinda over priced too.
1228,1,5.0,1,2014-01-12,"Came in on a Sunday afternoon. Wasn't too busy. There was a great, throwback vibe to the place. Checkered tablecloths, bottles of soda, a bright red neon sign in the back. It just felt like old America. As I sit down, I am promptly greeted by my waitress, who runs me through the menu like a pro and recommends the vodka pie. She was very friendly and eager to please. She brought me delicious free bread and joked with me throughout my meal. I received my pizza prompt and hot. It was fantastic. The ingredients played off each other in perfect harmony. Prosciutto, mushrooms, cheese, basil. With each bite I wanted more. It was the best NYC pizza experience I've ever had."
1229,1,5.0,1,2014-01-09,"This place might not have the scene that Lucali's and Giuseppina's have, it definitely doesn't have the exposure and hype of places like Di Fara, L&B's and Lombardi's, but if you peel all of that way away, this place can hold its own with any pizza restaurant in New York.  In a blind taste test with the top 10 NYC pizza places, it would, at the very least, be a contender.  Their pastas and sides are also very good, but food aside I love the feeling you get from Peppino's when you walk in. The place is truly a family-run business that focuses on one thing: giving diners a great experience."
1230,1,1.0,1,2014-01-03,"The pizza sauce tastes worse than from a can, watery like consistency. Toppings thrown on, too much ricotta on white pizza. Garlic crisps were soggy flavorless leftover pieces of crust."
1231,1,3.0,1,2013-12-08,I've been here twice. I got the spinach ravioli both times and it was really good. I do have a complaint though. I went there yesterday at around 10pm and this place was filthy! The floors were disgusting and we had to wipe crumbs out of our seats.
1232,1,5.0,1,2013-11-07,"This place is amazing! My boyfriend lives right by it and we came across this gem last year in the winter and it was so warm, cozy and smelled DELICIOUS. We ended up deciding to split a chicken roll, OMG so great and it was huge! It was enough to satisfy us both! The people that run the place are also as nice as can be, countless times they have given us garlic crisps on the house. Only downfall, closed mondays. I almost cried when i forgot that and we were outside their door."
1233,1,5.0,1,2013-11-07,"My wife and I moved across the street from Park Slope Peppinos about a year ago. We've been regulars ever since. I kept saying I was going to give a good shout out on yelp, but never got around to it. Tonight I just had to do it. My wife and I brought our 5 month old in here tonight, and once again, they treated us like family. After long hard days, it just feels great. I've lived in NYC for over 20 years and never felt such a family vibe as I do here. But we wouldn't come here regularly for that - it's also the case that the food is great. It just is. My mom is 100% Italian and I grew up eating the best. This is in the same league. We are so happy to have moved across the street from this gem."
1234,1,4.0,1,2013-11-03,"So far I've ordered a regular pie, margarita pie, chicken Cesar salad & chicken roll, all were very good. I see that this place has good rating for there plates, I'm yet to try it; but will soon. They lost a star because one day I called to order I believe a salad and a drink, they wouldn't deliver it because I was off by I believe two dollars, I really hate when places do this, like seriously...two dollars and you won't deliver it a couple of blocks, I really don't think the delivery person is going to mind considering he will get a tip, and why would a business want to lose out on $8 just because it wasn't $10. I'd rather have $8 more dollars than none, but hey that's me. So I guess when I order just for myself I have to get something extra that I really don't want just to have it delivered."
1235,1,5.0,1,2013-11-01,"My family love this place. I rarely write reviews . . .  Every time I come either for a pizza or for say eggplant parm . or seafood platter etc I am not disappointed. we also are treated so well, like family. if you see the seafood platter as a special other it, it is amazing."
1236,1,5.0,1,2013-10-26,"Brooklyn is known to have some of the best pies known to the Americas and after sampling so many pizza joints in Brooklyn, probably the best I have ever tasted is right around the corner of our house!!! After living here for over a year, Didn't even know we were missing out on one of the best pizzas my tastebuds have ever known. I'm sorry tastebuds, but now you can now be oh si satisfied . The bread!!! Is it the water? The moisture & them pasture in the oven ? Chewy thin , crisp and the sauce is too die for. Kids were over the moon with their pasta which u tried and almost switched to eating theirs. No line, no over hyped advertising , just a great family Italian restaurant who likes kids."
1237,1,5.0,1,2013-09-11,"Happend to be in the area and was looking for someplace to eat.  We stopped in here after reading the reviews on yelp.  I originally passed it and looked in thinking, ""Man it looks hot in there"" because the whole front was open.  Not realizing that was the place I was looking for but I took a chance.  We had lasanga w/ a mixed vegetables on the side, spinach ravioli, tomato and mozzarella.  The bread to start was slightly different.   Tasted homemade similar to pizza dough.  Either way it was delisious.  The tomato and mozzarella was fresh and tasty.  Our dinners were both very good. Oh and the mixed vegetables were real mixed veggies they put together not from a bag. Was very happy I stopped in and I will be back.  Also, it was not hot in the restaurant at all."
1238,1,5.0,1,2013-09-08,"It's a miracle! I have found my Italian food sanctuary! After a couple drinks at the local bar, we walked up to 5th ave and were torn between the diner and this place that I caught in the corner of my little brown eye. We flipped a coin (literally) and lucky for us the choice was Peppinos. As we were walking in a big group was leaving. Since it was close to 11pm I was afraid they were getting ready to close but the owner of the place assured us it was alright, making us feel right at home. Though they were cleaning up not ONCE did they try and rush us. The waitress was super sweet and friendly, and the food came out quickly. We didn't get to try the bread since they were out but they did give us some free pieces of bruschette. This was heaven in my mouth! The bread was so warm and moist, garlicky goodness underneath a bed of delicious red onions and tomatoes. SOOOO GOOD! I also love Pasta Fagioli so I got a bowl. This wasn't as great...kind of bland. Think it needed a garlic clove and some salt but good nonetheless. Next came out my Penne Alla Vodka and my friend's Penne Alla Boscaiola. It was delicious! They give you a ton of food, and the flavor was on point. The peas really added to the whole dish. My friend's food was equally appetizing. I will say the prices are a wee bit higher than the average Italian spot but  this place totally makes it worth it. After gobbling up what we could from our huge pasta plates, the owner chit chatted with us as they got ready to close and gave us some menus so we can order next time we were at work. It's been a while since I've had such a friendly staff serve me. Great food, great people. Can't wait to come back and try some brick oven pizza!"
1239,1,4.0,1,2013-09-07,"Peppino's make really, really good pies it has to be said, although I've never been to their Bay Ridge location.  A little pricey, sure, but they have Park Slope real estate prices to be dealing with and the ingredients are high quality.  Top notch sauce and good cheese, they're only a few yards behind the tall trees like Totonno's and Juliana's in the crust stakes, but it's high praise even putting them in the same sentence.   In any other town, this place would hold legendary status - too bad they're in the pizza mecca of Brooklyn."
1240,1,4.0,1,2013-09-01,"Best pizza in south park slope.  I don't know if it's because clearly all the Italians go here or that it is also Italian run, but ya it is pretty damn good.  I get the baby size (ie personal pizza) margherita."
1241,1,5.0,1,2013-08-28,"Delicious pizza. Reminds me of Grimaldi's minus the wait time. Chewy crust, savory cheese, flavorful sauce. The Margherita pizza here is fantastic. The restaurant is cute and service here is good. A nice little pizza joint in Park Slope."
1242,1,4.0,1,2013-08-16,"The food here is absolutely delicious. And it's just a calm environment where it's always pleasant to sit down and eat, even when it's crowded. Friendly staff. Prices aren't too bad."
1243,1,4.0,1,2013-08-15,"I live nearby, and I discovered this place a few months ago, as I had an urge to have some pizza, so I walked in.  I was shocked at how good the pizza was in such an unassuming place! The pizza looks like it's made from fresh ingredients, and it tastes like so. The more and more I eat this pizza the more I'm liking it, so far it hasn't disappointed. The service is not that good, at least a couple of times I went with some friends, seems like they have to work on training their employees. But, as long as they keep producing such great pizza, I'll ignore the so-so service."
1244,1,4.0,1,2013-08-11,"Really good pizza here. The diavola is awesome, the sausage is really fresh and has a bit of spice that makes it very enjoyable. Beer's a little pricey at 4.50 for a Brooklyn pint, but it's not a bar, so I can let it pass. I'd like to go back and give their cheesesteaks a world. I thought the prices were pretty reasonable too."
1245,1,4.0,1,2013-07-24,"If, for the rest of my life, I could either only go to this place or to Franny's, I would choose Peppino's in a heartbeat. It's not fancy, it doesn't serve ramps, and you're more likely to see an off-duty cop eating there than a Gyllenhaal -- but it's delicious, mellow, and affordable. Every waiter I've had has been friendly and attentive. The pizza arrives quickly and with a nice slight char on its crust. Whenever I eat here, I leave full and in a good mood, which is more than I can say about a whole bunch of restaurants that regularly appear on the lists of the Best this or that. Go! (But don't make it so crowded that I have to wait for a table)."
1246,1,4.0,1,2013-07-17,"We frequently order here for staff meetings. They sandwiches are the winner...chicken parm, eggplant parm, grilled chicken w/ balsamic, & cheesesteak make everyone happy. To feed 40 people under $250 and still have food left over is great in my book."
1247,1,5.0,1,2013-07-09,Service was great and my favorite thing on the menu -- CHEESE STEAK SPECIAL! It's one of the tastiest!  I always order delivery and they're always quick and food still taste great.
1248,1,1.0,1,2013-06-21,"We were scheduled to play a Make Music New York festival performance at Peppino's South Slope today and the manager was such a complete jerk.  We were scheduled by the Park Slope 5th Ave BID to play there and it was made clear there would be electricity available, but the manager made it clear that he didn't know anything about it, in spite of the MMNY poster taped to the inside of his front window, and that he was too busy to direct me to an outlet to run power out to the street.  He spent more time making calls about the situation and telling me that he was busy than would have been required to plug in a power cord.  Amazingly, he walked away from free music, and world class musicians that would surely have drawn a crowd and gotten the business more money.  Please don't go here for food as there are may pizza places in South Slope and many of them have reasonably polite managers who make good business decisions."
1249,1,4.0,1,2013-06-12,"Tasty pizza, decent size meals.. they are generous on their subs too. The salad is average, wasn't so fond of it but they have speedy service. If you want your food and you want it fast, check them out.. you wont be disappointed."
1250,1,4.0,1,2013-06-11,"Went to Peppinos tonight and it was very good....The atmosphere is welcoming and the service was great!  We had the mozzarella and tomato to start off (so fresh), then the pizza (half vodka and half Margherita) the crust was so crisp and chewy at the same time..and then finished with pasta (sauce was very homemade and delish!!).  The staff was polite and always checking in on us to see if we needed anything. Definitely a place to have a nice casual dinner...I will definitely be back. Thanks Peppino for giving me a new spot to hangout with friends and also a place to bring my out of town guest! YUM!"
1251,1,5.0,1,2013-05-31,"SO GOOD.  The pizza was delicious (we had spicy sausage and olives), and the service was prompt, polite, and friendly.  I've lived in the neighorhood for three years, and I can't believe it's taken me this long to discover Peppinos.  The decor and ambience is a bit lacking, but we will definitely be returning."
1252,1,4.0,1,2013-05-30,"Great brick oven pizza in Park Slope with friendly staff.  The restaurant itself doesn't really stand out, looks like your typical neighborhood pizza joint but the brick oven pies are definitely better than any other I've had in the vicinity.  If they had their 2 slices for $5 special late at night I'd be here all the time!"
1253,1,4.0,1,2013-05-13,"I have to admit, I wasn't sure what to expect when walking in, and didn't expect the pizza here to be as good as it was. We started with the bruschetta, which was delicious. The bread was toasted perfectly; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Though I don't remember details, the pizza was delicious. We ordered a large Margherita, and each component had a distinct and robust flavor. Not too sure how to feel about the ambiance. It was OK, but the opera music was a bit too dramatic for the restaurant, and the superimposed family pictures on the wall were too personal and intimate for my taste. The service was good. I usually like to write longer reviews, with more details, but it's been a little while since I visited Peippino's. Since everything was enjoyable, there's a good chance I will return and update my review, but the pizza earns a solid four stars."
1254,1,5.0,1,2013-05-10,This is the best Italian restaurant ever. The pizza is excellent.  I have also had the eggplant parm and pasta dishes which were all very good.  The service is excellent too. I will definitely keep coming back.
1255,1,5.0,1,2013-05-08,"My husband and I have been twice so far and both times we were very happy with the service and food. The first time my husband got a pizza and I got the mixed salad with chicken. The salad was really good for a pretty simple salad, but if you'er a salad eater you know how easy it is for places to mess it up. Our second visit we ordered a meatball sub and salad to share and both were really good and they even split them for us, which I thought was really nice. We will def. be back!"
1256,1,5.0,1,2013-04-16,"I am not sure what took us so long to find this place but we finally decided to try Peppino's after living in the neighborhood for almost two years. I could kick myself now that I know what we have been missing. They have perfected the pizza here. There is no comparison with other pizza by the slice joints in the area. The wood burning, brick oven makes all the difference. The pizza was fantastic but more than that, the service was above and beyond. Our server, Vito, was such a sweet guy!!! I never realized since we headed home after our meal but I left my wallet at Peppino's. It was hand delivered to our door by an employee at Peppino's. Everything was in it's place. Thank you so much Peppino's. You have two more loyal customers!"
1257,1,4.0,1,2013-04-04,"We were a huge group of 16 yesterday for lunch, and they sat us right down.  We ordered a billion pizzas and tons of salads and they didn't blink.  Peppino's is really great!  The food we ate was delicious, the service was top notch, and the price didn't break the bank.  This was an absolutely glorious NYC Pizza experience.  I'd recommend that anyone and everyone check this place out."
1258,1,4.0,1,2013-03-28,"I came here on a Sunday night, there was quite a few people. It had a nice atmosphere. I've ordered pick up from here before but never ate in, but this Sunday was different! We got a bottle of wine, La Bastardo, which was delicious! (And I hardly ever really like red wines) We got olive and spinach on a margherita pizza and garlic bread to start. I enjoyed their garlic bread, there was plenty. The pizza itself had a good crunch to the crust and it had noticeably fresh ingredients. Service was welcoming and friendly, plus the restaurant had a home-y feel."
1259,1,5.0,1,2013-03-16,great brick oven pizza.  very friendly and helpful staff.  In my opinion the best pizza in brooklyn.
1260,1,5.0,1,2013-02-25,I'm a lifelong Brooklyn resident who loves pizza. And I loved the pizza here.  This place has great brick oven pies. Cheese is real and fresh with just the right amount of saltiness. The sauce was absolutely delicious. The crust has just the right amount of burn to it. Loved it. Will def go back prices were good. Portion size was good for two to split on one six slice pie. Good service. And a nice clean atmosphere.
1261,1,5.0,1,2013-02-07,"This place has a great ""neighborhood pizza place"" vibe that I loved.  Red checkered tablecloths, parmesean and dried chili pepper shakers on the tables, friendly waitresses and staff, decent beer and wine list, and some nice menu items, mellow and kid-friendly atmosphere. But the best part about it - the pizza is WAY BETTER than your average ""neighborhood pizza place"".  The brick oven pies come out steaming hot with just the right amount of char to give it great flavor.  Tangy sauce and real mozzarella cheese.  The crust is light and relatively thin, with just the right amount of ""stretch"" and chewiness to it (but definitely not too chewy). I eat a lot of pizza.  I love pizza.  And this place really got me.  Not to mention, they were extra-accommodating when we wanted to split our pie 5/8ths 3/8ths, vs. half and half.  That was great. Love love love.  Will be back."
1262,1,5.0,1,2013-01-24,"I looove pizza, and this is IT. Second best to Grimaldis (which is my favorite) At Peppinos i've tried the Vodka Pie with Whole Wheat crust which was fantastic and the steak hoagie that was soo juicy it melts in your mouth. Check this place out, its a winner."
1263,1,4.0,1,2013-01-15,"Great italian joint. Great food and reasonable prices. Their brick oven pizza is AMAZING. If you haven't experienced Peppinos yet, you must."
1264,1,4.0,1,2013-01-13,Unfortunately I'm writing this review very late. I was here almost a year ago. Anyways I'm going to keep this simple. Brick oven pizza is always the way to go when u can. The pizza here is really good and I do plan on going back again. The prices do not reflect your average pizza spot but this is not your average pizza spot. If you find yourself in the area you should definitely atop in and try their pizza. It's really good!
1265,1,5.0,1,2013-01-11,"Professional service, delicious food, and consistency; what more can you ask for in catering and for dinner.  We've had them cater several family gatherings and they went far beyond what was expected; following up and coming back to make things absolutely perfect.  Can't say enough about these guys."
1266,1,5.0,1,2013-01-03,"I enjoy going there ,never let me down. Always fresh"
1267,1,4.0,1,2013-01-03,"Peppinos is delicious.  The garlic crisps are a MUST.  I'm a big Penne Vodka pizza fan so I would recommend that, but all their pizzas are pretty delicious.  Their deliver times are a bit slow though so they lost a star from me.  However, if you get a chance to walk in and try some food you definitely should.  The waiters are quite nice."
1268,1,4.0,1,2012-12-31,"I scoped this place out when looking for some conveniently located pizza in Brooklyn.  I like brick oven pizza more than standard New York pizza, so this looked like a pretty promising restaurant. The staff is friendly here; it really seems like a neighborhood joint.  They seemed to know their customers by name, based on what I gathered from the few others people there that time of day. I was delighted to see that they served Boylan's bottled sodas.  This is one of my favorite soft drink bottlers, and their ginger ale in particular goes great with this type of food. I went with a half margherita and half alla vodka pizza, individual sized.  This was a pretty good brick oven pizza, but not the very best I have had.  The alla vodka was much better than the margherita.  If I could try again, I would go with the Pizza Bianca or Puttanesca instead. Both halves could have used a little more goodies; the prosciutto seemed a bit sparse. Overall, this is a very good neighborhood pizza place, but not the best brick oven pizza you can find.  It's not a destination, but probably a place I would frequent often if I lived nearby."
1269,1,4.0,1,2012-12-26,"I am obsesseddd with their cheesesteak. Thanks to Elizabeth R.'s review, I gave it a try and now, always order it for lunch.. eat half and take the other half home for later. The delivery is always fast and they usually get my order right and put whatever else it is I request in the bag (forks, parm, napkins, etc.) Wouldn't hesitate ordering.. do itt!!"
1270,1,4.0,1,2012-12-10,"Peppinos is pretty nondescript both inside and out. The true treasure is in its brick oven pizzas. I have only had the standard margherita pie, but the crust is thin, crispy, flavorful, and the cheese and sauce are outstanding. It is close in distance to us and also in quality to some of the better pizza places in Park Slope and the prices are definitely great for the quality. If you are by yourself or in a small group, they do offer personal and medium pies. They also offer a special lunch deal of 2 slices and a soda for $5 - but I think that pizza is the standard cheese pie found at any parlor."
1271,1,5.0,1,2012-12-09,"This place is in my grandma's neighborhood.  We're from NJ so we don't come often, but this is definitely my husband's favorite Italian restaurant.  Everything we've had from here has been delicious!"
1272,1,5.0,1,2012-11-27,"tip: great brick oven pizza place with garlic crisps Diavola and Margherita were very crispy, tomato sauce very fresh.  i imagine they would only be good when their just out of the brick oven, else the crust would be soggy real fast.  garlic crisps are awesome, very garlicky."
1273,1,5.0,1,2012-11-11,Excellent service and the food is so amazingly delicious. This restaurant has a moms and pops type feeling. You feel cozy and can enjoy your meal without being squished into small tables.
1274,1,5.0,1,2012-11-10,cheesesteak cheesesteak cheesesteak cheesesteak !!! you'll thank me later.  eat here now!
1275,1,4.0,1,2012-11-10,"One of the better Pizza places in the slope.  They do sell cheese slices at lunch but is more of a sit down/deliver whole pie place.  It's also less fancy than some of the more high-end pizza joints, with checkerboard tablecloths.   Pies are made to order in a wood-fired oven, which is key.  Hot, tasty, brimming with ingredients.   If you want good pizza in a casual place, Peppinos will bubble your cheese."
1276,1,5.0,1,2012-11-08,"As far as Pizza goes, NY has a crazy amount of spots to try. But the best pizza I have come across is from Peppinos! It cheesy goodness will make anyone's day better, and I am not usually a pepperoni slice of pizza person, but here I am all about it! Every Saturday for lunch I come here to get two slice's of pizza and a soda for $5, closer to $6 if you get pepperoni. Many pizza places have that deal, but this pizza is REAL pizza, and I was so suprised that this place would have that special. If you're in the neighborhood, please make sure you get a slice of something amazing!"
1277,1,4.0,1,2012-10-29,"Possibly, maybe, on a good day the best pizza in South Brooklyn. The problem here is consistency. Some days this pizza is absolutely perfect and some days it's soggy and a little gross. This is actually a 50-50 issue here. But the days when it's good, it's goooood."
1278,1,4.0,1,2012-10-11,Peppinos in Park Slope is a friendly restaurant that makes very good brick oven pizza. The crust is exceptional if you like thin crusted pizza. The other ingredients were also quite good though we thought the sauce was a little too light and watery. All the serve staff made us feel welcome. It is a nice place for a midweek dinner.
1279,1,5.0,1,2012-09-09,"While we have never eaten in the restaurant, my fiancé and I have faithfully ordered delivery from Peppinos for about a year now. Their sandwiches are amazing!!! Finally, someone who knows how to make an eggplant hero! They are consistently friendly, fast, and the food always arrives piping hot. Every time we try a new dish on the menu, we are impressed!"
1280,1,4.0,1,2012-08-24,Solid brick oven pie.
1281,1,5.0,1,2012-07-30,"I love it so much.I was very sad when we had to move from south slope to sunset park as I would not get to go there as often as I want, or just walk past it every day. But they delivered the food to our area too."
1282,1,3.0,1,2012-07-18,Food is okay if you pick the correct one ! Service was okay.Bit pricey
1283,1,5.0,1,2012-07-17,"On first moving to Brooklyn from down South, I figured I was trading barbeque for pizza and set about trying to find a suitable pie that I could have delivered or was, at a minimum, easy to obtain. After a lot of trial and error (really just a lot of error), I finally stumbled upon Peppinos and haven't looked back since. This is my go to spot for a traditional NY style pizza these days. Sure, there are pizza joints that are arguably better but unless the pie is made of solid platinum, I'm not standing in line for an hour or more to get it. At the end of the day, it's just pizza. I'd much prefer a pizza that's nearly as good (and Peppinos is nearly as good) that comes right to my door. Peppinos pies start with a subtle and slightly sweet tomato base, then layered with fresh mozzarella and adorned with your choice of toppings. The pies are cooked in a coal fired oven so you get that spectacular blackening of the crust on the bottom. It really is a top notch pizza. Is this my favorite pie? No, that honor goes to the Tartufata at Toby's. But this is, by far, the best delivery pie I've had in NYC. Well worth giving Peppinos a shot on one of those nights where you just have no desire to cook anything and are craving a great slice."
1284,1,4.0,1,2012-06-24,We order pizza here at least once a month and every time it is great. We love the margarita pepperoni pizza - the pepperoni is tasty and the mozzarella is delicious! Plus you get pretty fast delivery. Have to love that!
1285,1,2.0,1,2012-06-18,"Wanted to love it.  Looked great coming out.  Fell short though. Too much oil/grease.  Good amount of cheese and sauce and even the crust had a good texture (not too soft, not too crispy or charred) but just no flavor. 2 stars since I sure have experienced better slices. But 5 stars for friendly service and a $5.00 2 slice/soda Recession deal!! Nice owners I'd say."
1286,1,4.0,1,2012-06-03,"On one of our shopping trips in Park Slope, we wander in the neighborhood looking for a quick place to stop for lunch. We noticed Peppinos in the area. Their chicken caesar salad was delicious! Hearty and filling heaps of romaine lettuce, crouton, and chunky pieces of grill chicken in casear dressing. We also shared a baby margherita pizza, piping hot thin crust with fresh mozzarella,  tomato sauce, basil, and olive oil. Normally, we would had indulge ourselves if it weren't for our sweet tooth crave here and there. Luckily, we saved room for dessert since my husband spot another place nearby. I'll def be back to try their pasta and bread. Loved the friendly service as well!"
1287,1,5.0,1,2012-06-03,"Not sure how I've gone so long without rating this place.  I eat here at least once every other week and I go here any time we have family or other out of town guests.  The margarita pizza is one of the best I've ever had.  I usually add pepperoni.  As good as it is to get delivered, sinking my teeth into a piping hot pizza in the restaurant is fantastic.   Seating in the actual restaurant is surprisingly easy and surprisingly child friendly.  We don't have kids but it's nice to know of a place that is easy to navigate for friends."
1288,1,3.0,1,2012-05-24,It's Brick oven.  It's good.  It's Pricey.  Take advantage of the fresh cannoli when they appear on the menu.
1289,1,3.0,1,2012-05-24,"Decent pizza, albeit slightly soggy and limp (maybe from delivery time?). Wife's Raviolis were excellent and the sauce on them were phenomenal - may try a pasta dish next time as the red sauce was delicious."
1290,1,5.0,1,2012-05-22,This place is absolutely wonderful. The wait staff is extremely courteous and attentive and the brick oven pizza is incomparable to others in Brooklyn or other boroughs. They also have pasta and sandwiches that are worth trying. The restaurant has a very home-ey and relaxed atmosphere that makes you want to go back and bring your friends and family.
1291,1,5.0,1,2012-05-15,I just moved to Park Slope and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. Little did I know I was about have one of the best pizza and prosciutto sandwich ever. Love the doo wop / Frankie Valli mix playing over the speakers as well. Can't wait to go back and try some of the pastas.
1292,1,5.0,1,2012-05-15,"Local pizza place worth going out of your way for. The Pizza a la Vodka is crazy good. John's on Bleeker is probably my favorite pizza place in NY, but this is a close second, way better than Grimaldi's. It can be a little pricey but you'll be satisfied. The pasta and heros are good as well. The garlic crisps and bread are yummy and plentiful and the salads are a good size (and their vinegar is delicious.) Other apps have been good as well. Delivery is reliable and accurate with the time estimation they give you. They are also super nice."
1293,1,5.0,1,2012-04-28,"My first time at Peppino's and thanks to fellow Yelpers we decided to stop for pizza at this restaurant before getting on the Verrazano bridge and returning to Virginia.  I grew up on Long Island, so I know good pizza and I couldn't let our group leave without tasting some authentic NY pizza.  The place is tiny, but efficient, the service was friendly and fast.  The food is outstanding! They cook in a brick oven, and everything has the most amazing crust with a char.  Our drinks arrived quickly, fresh bread was brought to the table.  The bread was simple but amazing.  We decided to split a Margherita pizza, a plain calzone and a meatball parmigiana roll.  The pizza was absolutely delicous, the calzone was THE BEST I've ever tasted.  The meatball parmigiana roll was very good, but the previous two items were outstanding.   The manager insisted upon making us a second pizza because there was  a hole (we didn't see it) in the first pizza since the center was too thin.  We said it wasn't necessary but he insisted, so we had another pizza to take with us and we left a great tip for our server. I'm nosy so I had to ask the table next to us what they'd ordered, their pizza had prosciutto and mushrooms and they were raving about it.  Definitely worth the money, great food, great service, good prices.  Business is booming too, there were tons of carry out and delivery orders leaving.   I can't wait for my next trip to New York, a meal at Peppino's will definitely be on our itinerary!"
1294,1,5.0,1,2012-04-18,"I can't help myself any longer.  I have to upgrade to 5 stars.  This place is just outstanding, regardless of the high tariff.  The pizza and pasta dishes are ridiculously good, as are the few apps I've tried, as well as their home-made bread.  To top it all, the staff are always so friendly, helpful and pleasant.  Top notch."
1295,1,4.0,1,2012-03-26,"GREAT margherita pizza! i really enjoyed it. the personal (10"") with a salad was good for two meals. $17, so a little pricey for pizza but i have no regrets. the tomato sauce was perfect and the mozz cheese fresh. the brick oven added the perfect authentic touch. i'll definitely be back for more of this"
1296,1,3.0,1,2012-03-19,"We tried Peppinos for the first time and placed an order for delivery. I will give them 5 stars for customer service but only 2.5 stars for food. The guy who took my order was very sweet, when he heard i was ordering for the 1st time, he gave us a complimentary appetizer and also upgraded our baby size pizza to a medium pizza for free. Delivery was quick. So they did great on the service side. Now on the food side, the bruschette was tasty. The mozzarella and tomato was ok. The mozzarella was not very fresh. The marinara pizza was very bland. The sauce lacked flavors. Overall the pizza was quite tasteless. The veggie pie pizza was better. It was loaded with a lot of chunky vegetables. But once again, overall the pizza was lacking flavors. It was missing the taste of fresh herbs. Their service was definitely excellent, but food was not!"
1297,1,5.0,1,2012-03-04,"I've been holding off trying Peppino's because I thought they looked pricey. $15 for a small pizza? I took the plunge and decided to order a 'baby' size pizza. I thought to myself, ""I can't order a baby size pizza, i'm a man! A MAN!"" But then I figured, how small can the pizza actually be? So I ordered the Quatro Stagioni pizza for pickup. It was a BEAUTIFUL pizza. Probably about 10 inches wide, with 4 slices. All of the ingredients high quality, and the crust with the right amount of char. I never used to understand why having a little bit of a blackened edge is a good thing. If your pizza has tons of tasty toppings, the blackened part helps to clean your palate a little bit between slices. Otherwise, the flavors(and oils) build up in your mouth until it just doesn't feel right anymore. I can't wait to go back to this place and try all of their other stuff(some good looking pastas and sandwiches). I should also mention that their staff was extremely friendly, even on crowded, busy night. That tells me that this place is quality."
1298,1,3.0,1,2012-02-21,"Nice pizza restaurant. Marguerita pizza is great, but expensive"
1299,1,5.0,1,2012-01-17,"Man, what a great night at Peppino's. So we were a party of 3 and we took the large table in the window for the street view and the leg room. Great service, he talks us into making a good beer choice (a small run Italian hefeweizen with a nice looking bottle). A large party comes in, and they ask us if they can get the big table. We oblige, being polite dapper gentleman on the eve of our show at Freddy's Bar down the way. The restaurant gives us a Bruschetta and another beer on the house (we had one initially split 3 ways). Great Bruschetta. And the pizza? Molto bene. Brick crust and everything melt in your mouth. The table that bumped us? Tossed another 2 more of those beers. Great things do happen to beautiful people. Great and attractive staff, prompt service, and the food had it goin' on. I would come back, with bells on."
1300,1,4.0,1,2012-01-16,"Definitely the best delivery pizza in Park Slope. Compared to other local pizza that has rubbery crusts or weird tasting sauces, this pizza was really good. It will definitely be our go-to place for pizza delivery."
1301,1,5.0,1,2012-01-07,I'm so glad they're just a few blocks away. I don't really like pizza but when that pizza has mushrooms and vodka sauce on it with fresh ingredients I get easily addicted. And so does my roommate. Plus they have a two slice drink recession special that beats most other meals in this area. Yesss!
1302,1,4.0,1,2011-12-13,Great Italian takeout!
1303,1,5.0,1,2011-11-21,"This place does it right. The pizza is what we go for. Brick oven, tasty sauce, quality toppings, chewy/crispy/light crust, reasonable price, AND consistency (aka never burnt) ?!? You get it all here. We are often here after 9 pm with the family for a late night pizza with friends. Kids are totally OK. The service is amazing. It must be family run. You don't get that kind of calm confidence and mastery of the menu from just anyone, Everyone is laid back but cares about what come out of the kitchen. Message to Peppinos: PLEASE DON'T LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD! The entire family loves this place. When you say ""hey, let's grab a pizza"" and the kids chime back ""Peppinos?,"" it's all good ..."
1304,1,3.0,1,2011-10-01,"I've only ever had deliveries so can't comment on the restaurant experience. Love the Pizza Alla Vodka. Perfect base and a great mix of toppings. Also the Orrechiettie pasta is awesome as long as you like a lot of oil and garlic, the latter of which I actually don't (I realize this makes me a freak) but I eat it anyway it's just that good. Fusilli Fridiavola is well worth it too. Delivery is a little slow at peak times but that's not really an issue. Two things bother me for which they lost a couple of stars (it'd be 1.5 stars if this was an option). Firstly, we ordered a Diavola pizza and it was not good. Not bad, just not good. Too much tomato not enough cheese and sausage. It might have been an off day. Secondly, and more importantly, it is expensive. I just don't think a pizza should ever cost $25 once you add the tax. The pizza is big but not THAT big. It is yum though. I kinda want to order it now."
1305,1,5.0,1,2011-09-28,"This place is awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great prices, large portion, brick oven pizza is amazing !!! Service is wonderful this place is my favorite spot. great deal for 2 slices of pizza and a drink for 5 bucks !!!"
1306,1,4.0,1,2011-09-21,"In search of the best pizza in NY I happened upon this place. Although it didn't turn out to be the holy grail of pizza, it was quite good none the less, thoroughly enjoyed it. Ordered half pepperoni and half alla vodka, soo good. Felt like an authentic brooklyn pizza shop too, great atmosphere."
1307,1,3.0,1,2011-09-18,"The pizza was fine, a little pricey.  I don't know why people have gushed on here about the pizza, it was ok, not bad, not great or anything.  I will stick with Pinos."
1308,1,4.0,1,2011-09-11,"Ordered the Antipasto, Bruschette, and a small Margharita pie with sausage.  Bruschette - Fantastic, though I do usually prefer slightly more crunchy bread, it was still great with excellent ingredients on top.  Antipasto - Also very good.  Very fresh mozzarella and tomato, delicious roasted pepper, sundried tomato, olives and some fantastic baked flatbread.  My only critique is the artichoke hearts need to be better seasoned or use a different brand perhaps.  Pizza - Consistent with the rest of the meal - excellent, but not the best I've ever had (that would be in Italy though, so a hard comparison!).  The sauce and cheese are fresh and I like the thin crust which is not too crunchy but not soggy.  I wasn't amazed with the sausage, though I don't usually order that - my wife wanted it, though neither of us liked it all that much.  Still, a great pizza."
1309,1,4.0,1,2011-09-06,"Came up here to Brooklyn, which is really ""home"" but now living in DC...so the 1st order of business as we drive into NY is head over to Brooklyn to get some pies! Peppinos was the closest stop to where we were so be it. We hit the jack pot as Peppinos delivered in every way to satisfying my need for awesome NY Pizza's I took my first bite of the Garlic crisps ""WOW"" I realized what I have been missing down in DC. The crisps are fantastic but save room for the real meal. We ordered a Margherita and a Diavola. My kids, my wife...we loved every bite. The ingredients were fresh, the crust was perfect, the brick oven smell, taste...fantastic. The service was great here too, nice smiles and attentive. I cannot wait to come back to Peppinos when I am back in town...this place is a must try in the arsenal of NY Pizza places...."
1310,1,3.0,1,2011-09-04,"Stopped at Peppinos for pizza this evening.  Times like this, I wish Yelp would institute a 1/2 star scale because I would really like to give Peppinos a 3.5 star.  However, since I can't (get the hint Yelp), I feel Peppinos is closer to a 3 star than a 4 star. For starters, the pizza here is very good - just not the best I've had in town.  I had a 4 topping pizza with mushrooms, olives sausage and pepperoni.  Price wise, I thought Peppinos was a little on the high side (the pizza was $25.00).  Also, the portions are not overly large. Now that I've been critical, here's some of the finer points...  B wait at all (always a plus).  Also, the menu does have lots of choices including sandwiches, salads and pasta."
1311,1,4.0,1,2011-08-29,"So so so good. The pizza was very well done - cheese, toppings, and the like were all exquisite! Crust just the right thickness (I like it when pizza crust is a little thinner). Fresh mozzarella cheese. Pepperoni to die for. Too bad I was just here staying with a friend - I would most definitely order from them in the future. A must in Park Slope, seriously. I know good pizza when I see it."
1312,1,5.0,1,2011-08-24,holly pie Batman!  (sorry...the Super Hero Supply shop is only blocks away) These guys cut no corners on the quality of their ingredients.  Toss in brick oven goodness and you've got one heck of a pizza.  Each slice was structured and layered with beauty and solid in the taste dept (quatro staggioni).  I strongly recommend this place.
1313,1,2.0,1,2011-08-19,"Pizza (quatro staggioni) = solid.  Good ingredients:  veggies were fresh, sauce was seasoned but didn't overpower the tomatoes in the base Delivery = substandard.  Called and was quoted a half hour delivery time, took just under an hour.  Both the driver and the person who answered the phone when I called back were indifferent. Advice to Peppinos = Don't overpromise and you won't disappoint."
1314,1,5.0,1,2011-08-10,"So, the hubs and I ended up here after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge and seeing the ridiculous line at Grimaldi's. A quick train ride out to Park Slope brought us to Peppino's, and thank God it did. :) This place is fantastic. Definitely the best pizza I've ever had. We did a half vodka, half ham, artichoke and olive pizza. So ridiculously good. The crust was amazing. We also had some lobster bisque which was pretty good also. The service was great. If you're already trekking out to Brooklyn for pizza, skip the crazy wait at Grimaldi's and head to Peppino's instead."
1315,1,4.0,1,2011-08-05,"I really like Peppinos - though I do wish they had a more enticing reason for me to stop by more frequently. I live very, very close so I would like to take advantage of their great pizza more often; but unfortunately their really good pizzas are not sold by the slice.  With Joe's pizza being right up the block I often opt for Joe's just for the sake of variety. Admittedly Peppinos has much higher quality in their regular menu but so many of us in the neighborhood are just picking up dinner for ourselves, and I think that Peppinos is designed to sit down with a family. Personally, I would like to see at least  one of their specialty pizzas available by the slice daily."
1316,1,5.0,1,2011-08-04,"the exterior of peppino's might trick you into thinking it's just another dingy pizza joint in Brooklyn.  don't be fooled.  inside, you will find friendly and attentive wait staff, crispy brick-oven crust, spicy pepperoni, fresh bufala mozzarella, and the best homemade pasta fagioli i've ever tasted.  go to peppino's now!!!"
1317,1,5.0,1,2011-07-30,Amazing brick oven pizza delivered to your door. Take that grimaldi's
1318,1,4.0,1,2011-07-17,"My husband and I love Peppino's. Up until recently we lived just a few blocks away and it was our go-to place for really excellent brick oven pizza. We were fortunate to live with several excellent pizza options in the hood (Anthony's on 7th is good, and Toby's Public House has some mean pizza too and a dessert calzone to die for). Peppino's ended up winning out against other places though because they have a great selection and their pies don't get crazy expensive. If you love the crunchy chewy thin crust pizzas with fresh  homemade sauce (not sweet), fresh mozzarela and excellent quality toppings, this is a go-to place. Have ordered extensively from their menu and it's all good. On top of all the great food, Carmela and the staff are always welcoming and friendly. Never seen anyone here have an off day. There are really amazing pizza places with a lot of hype and waits. Those places are still great to go to every so often but this was our everyday place. We always felt pretty lucky to live just a few blocks away. Now we live in Austin and will NEVER get this quality of pizza without a cross-country trek back to the neighborhood. I'll miss them."
1319,1,4.0,1,2011-06-23,"Okay, so order whole pies from this place and they are great! Single slices not as much so, but the whole pies, especially the "" Quattro Stagioni"" - tomato sauce, artichokes, black olives, ham, mushrooms & fresh mozzarella kick ass. Solid pizza if you're in the area, but I wouldn't travel too far for it..."
1320,1,5.0,1,2011-06-16,My go to place in the neighborhood.  Decently priced really really good pizza and cheap beer.  Comfortable place to sit with friends.  Just ordered it last night for dinner.  The Margherita and Pizza Biaca are the best.
1321,1,5.0,1,2011-06-04,"The best pizza folks, i was born in Brooklyn and these people know how to make a pie, Plus its unpretentious and you leave stuffed, The yuppies dont know pizza, this is the best,"
1322,1,5.0,1,2011-05-31,"This has been the best pizza I have had in the area by far.  Fresh basil and mozzarella alone are fantastic, and any topping you add will make it better"
1323,1,5.0,1,2011-05-30,"In the abundance of water, the yuppies are thirsty. They pop into Campo de Fiori and chomp down on extremely-overpriced crappy gimmick pies while the real old Brooklyn gems are right under their noses. Peppinos has a good brick oven that burns hot enough to make a thin crust that's neither droopy nor brittle. It has good NYC tap water and skilled Brooklyn hands working the dough. The ambiance is bleh. The servers are generally 17 year olds from the local Catholic Girls Schools (cute but confused). It's not too expensive and it's far less full of itself than Grimaldi's (good God try getting in there on a fuckin tuesday, forget weekends), Lombardi's (Pompous ass clientele & over-rated pies) or even the real Brooklyn Rivals DiFara & Totonno's. Both of which are still kicking but I mean Dom ain't gettin any younger, a slice is now $6 (I shat myself when I saw that) and his place is over run with annoying yuppies congratulating themselves for taking the Q train past Grand Army Plaza for the first time..."
1324,1,4.0,1,2011-05-13,Great & reasonably priced salad..... The delivery was a bit slow but the food was good!!!!
1014,1,4.0,1,2011-05-01,"My friends took me here saying that they had found a place better than Lombardi's. I'm obseeeeeessed with Lombardi's, and with pizza in general lately, so I welcomed the challenger with open arms. We decided on the meatball pizza and started with a caprese and a caesar salad. The tomatoes and mozzarella were huge and pletiful and fresh and tasted great with a splash of balsamic vinegar. I know it seems so silly and simple, but it's easy to make a crappy and unsatisfying caesar salad and this one was the opposite. It was delicious and had the perfect amount of dressing. Our pizza was definitely good. Huge leaves of basil and thick slices of meatball and toasty crust. I personally wouldn't go so far as to say it was better than Lombardi's, but it definitely didn't disappoint. I should also point out that our server was incredibly sweet and attentive and personable. A great local pizza joint."
1325,1,5.0,1,2011-04-27,"we have been long time fans of Peppinos. without a doubt a must try for delivered pizza, in our opinion they are the best tasting delivered pizza available. never had to wait more than 40 mins. always hot. and most importantly consistant."
1326,1,5.0,1,2011-04-16,"Yum.  So, so happy to discover this place only a couple blocks from our new apartment.  It is our go-to for delivery, and is even better straight out of the oven in their cute little restaurant.  I also love that I can get their dough for $3 and try to re-create at home.  We especially love the pizza with Vodka sauce.  Not much else to say... great pizza, friendly service, good delivery!"
1327,1,5.0,1,2011-03-26,Great italian food!
1328,1,4.0,1,2011-03-06,"Great pizza. Good sauce, quality ingredients, love the fresh basil, crust is great, but had  a couple pies with slightly burnt crust. Also, quick delivery, BUT, make sure to ask the woman on the phone to read your order back to you before you hang up. We've had several orders missing an ingredient or two. Still, our go-to pizza in the slope."
1329,1,4.0,1,2011-03-03,"Too fast.  That's my complaint.  lol I asked how long an order would take, and I was informed 30-45 minutes.  That was perfect, as I was expecting my boyfriend home in 25 minutes, and he was paying.  Truth be told, they showed up in about 15 minutes, and I was stuck there, feeling like an ass for holding this guy up as we waited the extra ten minutes for my boyfriend to arrive to pay.  :P He was very polite, despite this, so we gave him a good tip.   But be careful, don't make any plans during the delivery time, or there's a good possibility you'll end up seeing them earlier than you expected. Food was good, too, if you're curious.  :P"
1330,1,5.0,1,2011-01-23,Super tasty pizza!  My favorite delivery in Brooklyn!  I also really enjoy the Caeser salad.
1331,1,5.0,1,2011-01-22,"This is the second Peppinos location to open in Brooklyn, with the first in Bay Ridge (same owners). Can't say enough about this place, the food is top quality, the ambiance is perfect, prices are very good and the service is fantastic. I've had a bunch of different dishes from Peppinos and they all have been great. Try the penne alla vodka, with peas, proscuitto and chicken....wow!!! I've also had the fresh mozzarella hero, spinach ravioli and the eggplant parmagiana and they have all been great. Get the cold antipasto and/or some clams to start (the clams are CLEANED and taste authentic, this is important). Last time i went they also gave complimentary mini foccaccia.   Lastly, the pizza is awesome! You can get 6 or 8 slice pies and they come in a bunch of different varieties. If you are on the fence about that to order, go with the margharita pizza and you will be very happy. Gotta get to Peppinos for some great Italian food! They also deliver and cater..."
1332,1,5.0,1,2011-01-10,"A girls night in with Natalia O., we ordered pizza (her fave) from Peppinos. It was, for lack of a better word absolutely delicious! If I could give 6 stars for this pizza I would and I'm not a pizza person. The crust was just perfect, the cheese just the right amount of saltiness and the sauce, perfectly sweet and mouthwatering. Delivery took less time than grub hub indicated. About 30 mins.  Delivered fresh and piping hot to my door all for $20. That includes the tip. All that yummy goodness with and a bottle of white wine = awesome dinner."
1333,1,5.0,1,2011-01-06,"I am a huge fan of New York pizza, and in my opinion, Pepinnos has the very best pizza in the city. The crust is what makes it great, as it does with all great pizza. It reminds me of the crust at John's Best (for anyone who knows that secret gem up in Mount Kisko). But what makes me love this neighborhood classic more than anything is the excellent service, friendly staff and family atmosphere (although we usually order in cause we live up street). I consider myself blessed for living near the best pizzeria in town!"
1334,1,3.0,1,2010-12-21,"We popped in here while on an apartment search. It was good, by no means the best pizza I've had in NYC. I had the vodka pizza and changed the mushrooms for tomatoes. Do not get me wrong, the sauce was yummy, cheese fresh. My crust was not as crunch as I like it from other places. I prefer Grimaldi's, L&B, Joe & Pat's or Joe's Pizza in the West Village"
1335,1,5.0,1,2010-12-06,"I joined Yelp specifically to give this place 5 stars. The food is totally delicious (the bruschetta is totally extra terrestrially delicioustown!) The service was amazing- the waitress and the busboy were attentive and polite.  The place is also just really homey and comfy on a early winter night.  While waiting for the bathroom, I admired all the children's drawing on the wall.  You know when a kid draws a picture of pizza and he or she writes ""I LOVE YOU"" they ain't lying.   Go get some!"
1336,1,5.0,1,2010-11-07,"Love this place. The best bruschetta I have ever eaten, topped with chopped tomatoes and garlic. I am addicted to their spaghetti with garlic and olive oil. And their pizza is incredible too, you can eat all of the crust."
1337,1,5.0,1,2010-11-06,"The best pizza I've had in NYC... a little expensive, but worth it!"
1338,1,5.0,1,2010-10-19,"One word: AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is no wait here, and service is FANTASTIC! Oh...did I forget to mention the pizza?!? Well watch out Grimaldi's, Peppinos is by far a better pizza."
1339,1,2.0,1,2010-09-21,"Why does this place exist when it's closed about 75% of the time? No matter what time of day I've gone by, I see it closed. I have only been able to successfully go one time, it happened to be a Saturday night. I went back a few weeks later on a Saturday night, and it wasn't opened. If you can actually go, it's worth it because the pizza was good. However, don't rely on it... and with such random hours, who knows how fresh the food will be anyway."
1340,1,3.0,1,2010-08-20,"Peppino's makes some very solid pizza. The ingredients are top notch, and the dough they use is particularly good. The interior has a family style appeal, great neighborhood place. My only complaint is that the prices are just a tad high for a local pizza joint. Their small plain pizza is $2 more than a small at Totonno's."
1341,1,4.0,1,2010-08-02,"if your Italian friend tell you it's a great pizza, you better trust him ;) the pizza is crispy, think and you can taste the fresh mozzarella all over the pizza. the Vodka sauce on a pizza is light and tasty. don't forget the to get the bruschetta for appetizer. Friendly waiters and nice pizzeria. This is the place I diffidently go again to discover their wonderful pizza or great sandwiches again."
1342,1,3.0,1,2010-08-01,"We checked out Peppino's because we were at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, and figured we'd take a walk through Prospect Park, grab some pizza, and then take the R train back to Manhattan. It was a bit a of a hike from BBG, but the reviews were so good on Yelp that we had to try it. We ordered the fried ravioli appetizer and they were delicious. Next up a small Margherita Pizza. Bleh. The ingredients were good, but the dough was burnt despite being spongy and not crispy at all. I've read reviews where the pizza was crisp and delicious so they must have problems with consistency. The service was awesome, and everyone was very friendly. My drink was never empty, which was good on a hot day where we had done a lot of walking. If I'm in the area again, I may give it another try, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way."
1343,1,5.0,1,2010-07-19,"Oh hell yes. Despite a low-end looking exterior, Peppino's makes a delicious, yet affordable, gourmet pie. The margherita is perfect - fresh basil, quality cheese, tangy sauce, chewy crust. Delivery is prompt, the person taking the orders is polite, and even strolling in and ordering a pie To Go doesn't result in an interminable wait. Can't speak to the dining-in experience - I abhor bright lights in restaurants and this place is lit up like an operating room so I've stuck to delivery and takeout. A great go-to pizza place. I hope they stay open forever and a day."
1344,1,4.0,1,2010-07-16,"Wow, brick oven pizza....delicious...I ordered something called Quattro Spuglioni?.The slices were hot and fresh, you could taste it's ingredients, the fresh tomato sauce, the basil, the olives,the EVOO(I love you Ms.Ray)the ham,the crispy thin crust and of course the cheese. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. The layout is kind of typical Italian style restaurant, plaid tablecloth, the decor was kinda weird, too much going on, you have a picture of Marilyn Monroe, the Brooklyn Bridge, a crucifix's, a picture of St. Pio, it was too much. But this place gets high praises, and I'll definitely be back."
1345,1,4.0,1,2010-05-28,Park Slope has a place to get good pizza... phew..... For a minute there...I lost myself...I lost myseeeeeelf! This is what you get...when ya mess with us. Families with babies rejoice! great proscuitto.  great tasting dough.  fresh basil.  very nice staff.  great coal oven taste. I know I will be ordering from here much as they have free delivery and they are very pleasant to deal with.
1346,1,5.0,1,2010-05-12,"It's a local pizza place with great brick oven pizza. The atmosphere is comfortable and it feels like a family-run joint. It's bright inside, so it might not be a great place for a first date. But, if you live nearby, this should be your go-to pizza place. Also: the cheesesteaks here are delicious."
1347,1,5.0,1,2010-04-29,"My Italian friend, Sal, from Brooklyn asked me what I wanted to eat while I was in town visiting for the weekend.  Two things came to mind--cannolis, and brick-oven-fired pizza from a legit pizzeria.  Sal took me here after a long day in the city to get some dinner.  We shared a large margherita pizza with italian sausage ('cause I like my meat, but also love a traditional margherita) and a shrimp oreganata served with linguini in a garlic-olive oil sauce.  The pizza was to die for!  You honestly can't get anything like that here on the west coast.  The linguini was meh--a little bland for my taste, but the shrimp was covered in this delicious rub rich in spices--I could easily imagine myself having an entire bucket of these while watching tv. ...Then we went took the F line back to Sal's place so I could have two more cannolis before heading to bed.  Mission accomplished"
1348,1,5.0,1,2010-04-06,"mmmmm delishh!!!...staff is very attentive and friendly, food is made fresh with much care...its not ur ordinary pizza spot, its a very cozy sit down resturant, with great choices...loved it here...will come back!"
1349,1,3.0,1,2010-03-26,"Pretty good -- and certainly a great option for non-NY style pizza in the South Slope. Nothing to travel for, though. I found the plain pizza to be undersalted and the beer selection isn't so hot. Eh."
1350,1,4.0,1,2010-03-15,"Great brick oven pizza...and even better is that they make whole wheat crust! I suggest the whole wheat pie with spinach. Only down side is they don't make a lot of it, so on a busy night, it can be hit or miss if they have it."
1351,1,4.0,1,2010-03-12,"This place has great pizza, good sandwiches and the wait staff is always REALLY nice.  Last time we were there they gave us free bruschetta for the hell of it... oh and they have $3 Peroni!"
1352,1,4.0,1,2010-03-10,Great sauce. Plain pizza is terrific. No broccoli though :( Also great chicken parm and the bread is fantastic!
1353,1,3.0,1,2010-02-26,"Its hard to impress me food wise so I only give this place 3 stars for now. I went for the first time yesterday since it was in the neighborhood and I decided to take a walk in the snow storm. I ordered a seafood salad, pasta fagioli soup and a margarita pizza with sausage. I am not a pig, I was with my boyfriend and we shared it all. LOL.   The seafood salad was really good but I could have done without the pitted olives. I love olives, just not pitted. The soup was sort of bland but could have been because my mouth was tainted with the oil and spices of the seafood salad. The pizza came out and it was thin which is good to me. The sausage was thinly sliced too. Service was good but we were one of three tables there so if service wasn't good, shame on them. I would go back to Peppino's to try other food on the menu but I like La Villa better so far."
1354,1,1.0,1,2010-01-26,Overpriced and mediocre.The Pizza  was burnt on the bottom. and the flavor were sub par. I ordered the veggie pie and the Margarita pizza. $43.90. This is Pizza not caviar. Next..
1355,1,4.0,1,2010-01-08,"This is a very nice time; I'd say hit the bruschetta for the appetizer, & get a pizza & a pasta dish for the dinner (I mean, assuming you go in a group of around 3-4; you might want more or less depending).  Plus-- Peroni is basically only good at places like this.  Get a draught!"
1356,1,5.0,1,2009-12-31,My favorite pizza in Park Slope. All their sandwiches are delicious. The meatball parm is a favorite. The staff is extremely friendly.
1357,1,3.0,1,2009-10-10,"The meatball roll was great, but the brick oven pizza didn't hold up well enough for delivery."
1358,1,5.0,1,2009-09-29,Incredible pizza...  crispy crust/delicious toppings and pretty much the friendliest service imaginable.  We ordered four pizzas to take out and they gave us free bottles of soda and free drinks while we waited.  We felt like family.
1359,1,4.0,1,2009-09-07,"We've continued to go to Peppinos and keep find ourselves there because we like it so much. Last night we had a great arugula, red onion and cherry tomato pizza. The service is always friendly and there's always space for us. Pros: Good, friendly service, delicious pizza Cons: Oddly enough, my son hates the tablecloths and always has (he's 5) : )"
1360,1,4.0,1,2009-07-14,"Not your average neighborhood pizza dive! Ranks with some of the city's thin-crust pantheons, both old and noveau. Fantastic calzones, too. BEWARE, does not travel well--not recommended for delivery unless you're pretty close by."
1361,1,4.0,1,2009-07-08,"A few of the other local delivery places raised their prices and lowered quality, Peppino's website informs they just reduced prices (slightly). If I'm craving traditional Brooklyn plain slice, I'll order from somewhere else, but this is my new default pizza delivery. The cheese steak wasn't bad either."
1362,1,4.0,1,2009-06-27,"Came here on Thursday for dinner with my parents who were in town. I chose Peppinos because I read a lot of good reviews and it certainly held up to it's reputation. Even with a group of 30 that was piling in when we arrived, the waiters were very attentive and pleasant. We ordered the garlic crisps as an appetizer and shared a large margherita pizza with pepperoni. I absolutely loved the fresh mozzarella on the pizza and the slices actually had substance unlike the flat-as-a-pancake slices I find everywhere in the city."
1363,1,5.0,1,2009-06-21,"Love it!   Had the ""Pizza Bianca"" or something like that.  White pizza.  Best I've had in the city. Also a neat looking old timey phone booth"
1364,1,4.0,1,2009-06-16,"Ok...I love bread...hence I love deep dish pizza's.  It also doesn't help that all my family lives in Chicago.  The thicker the crust, the better.  I even named my dog Gino after ""Gino's East Pizza"" in Chicago.  I stopped by Peppino's, ordered a mozzarella/tomato, sausage, and a mushroom pizza and thought they were pretty darn good.  The two guys that were working were super friendly.  Coming from Hawaii, this was my first taste of New York style pizza and it was pretty good.  Will I convert?  Maybe...since I hold no loyalties to either city.  I would return if I didn't have to struggle for parking.   If you ask me, I'd prefer a Hawaiian pizza for obvious reasons..."
1365,1,5.0,1,2009-05-12,"Friggin' good!!!  The crust is THE perfect paradigm of crisp, light chewiness.  And the proportion of cheese to topping to sauce was well balanced (I had margarehita w/pepperoni).   Maybe could have used a bit more basil, but really just a minor offense.     Casual and comfortable, but very clean and attentive waitstaff.   So happy to find good pizza in the neighborhood...tried some other ""must-haves"" and utterly disappointed."
1366,1,5.0,1,2009-04-23,"Peppino's is my new neighborhood love for 2 reasons - the brick oven is the bomb and the staff is super friendly and polite. You seriously feel like you are eating over at a friend's house and their ""recession special' is perfect - 2 slices (any kind) and a soda for $5 or maybe it's $6, I can't really remember. All I know is that I stopped by for lunch with a former east coaster craving good pizza, we both got 2 slices and a soda, caught up on old times for 2 hours, were never rushed to leave and only paid $12!   The staff is so welcoming.  Even if it's your first time there you feel like a part of the family.   Enjoy!"
1367,1,5.0,1,2009-04-11,I love when you go back again that the experience is just as amazing as the first time! We had the sausage pizza with tomato sauce and I loved that it wasn't too acidy. I love that they're fast and pleasant - this is my favorite and can't wait to try more of their pizzas!
1368,1,5.0,1,2009-03-29,"Decided on a whim to go to Peppino's with my roommates for a casual Sunday night dinner and boy am I glad we did! The ambiance was exactly what we were looking for - your typical neighborhood pizza place. Very clean, casual, and the waitstaff was very friendly- we felt right at home.   Our pizza was delicious - we ordered a large grilled chicken pie. The cherry tomatoes on it melted in your mouth and were perfectly complimented by mushrooms and of course, grilled chicken. We were also very impressed by the variety on the menu. I'll definitely be back to try a pasta dish. All in all a great choice!"
1369,1,5.0,1,2009-03-21,"Peppino's was a very pleasant surprise. We went there, honestly, because it was chilly and we were too lazy to go out to Di Fara.  We wanted pizza, but something good - not the normal crap that passes for a pie in the Slope.  When we decided against Di Fara, my next thought was Franny's - where else?  But that would've still ended up being a hike for us, and so we figured, no something closer. We had passed Peppino's several times and it looked inviting, but the prices were a bit off-putting - $17 for a margherita pie isn't outrageous for brick oven, but we've got kids, and these days every buck counts.  Still, we wanted something better than the usual fare, so we headed on down. We ordered a margherita but asked for some ricotta on it, and the mozzarella and tomato plate to start.  The mozzarella and tomato plate was uninspiring, fairly normal, but that's not a bad thing. The pizza itself was quite good - and surprisingly large.  Most of these brick oven places charge you twice what a normal pie runs and gives you something around the size of a frisbee and expect you to be blown away.  (Franny's is guilty of this, for instance, although the obvious art and effort that goes into their pies mostly makes up for it.)  This one, though, was full sized - and made with fresh mozzarella and herbed ricotta.  For that price, it was excellent.  The sauce was the best part - one of the best pizza sauces we've had in a while.  The crust was crisp on the edges, soft on the inside, firm and thick enough to hold the pizza together but not so thick that you feel like you're eating a piece of bread with sauce and cheese on top.  The only real downside was that there was actually too much cheese - we wish we had asked for extra sauce, or maybe a small cup of it on the side to dip into. The waiter also brought out - gratis - a mini pie, half margherita, half calzone, for us to try.  I'm not quite sure why - maybe because we had asked for ricotta on our pie, which is basically a different incarnation of the pie we got.  We weren't objecting. The service was a little distracted but very friendly, and very tolerant of our girls, who were feeling especially rambunctious.  They have kids drawings taped all over one of the walls, and everyone was smiling as they worked.  The decor was a little off - I think they weren't quite sure if they were upscale brick oven, local neighborhood joint, family-run establishment... it looked like a mix of all of the above. Overall, I'd recommend them pretty highly.  The prices were very affordable, and the pies very satisfying.  They aren't the best in the world, but in Park Slope?  Pretty close to it."
1370,1,5.0,1,2009-03-14,"As a resident of South Park Slope, I think I would have to move away if my neighborhood ever lost Peppino's.  What might seem like a slightly-above-average pizzeria/italian restaurant is actually a diamond in the rough.   From my personal fav Grilled Chicken Italiano Sandwich, to my other fav Putanesca Pizza, Peppino's just makes things that taste GREAT.   It might be the brick oven, it might be the unique sauce they use, or the fresh mozarella cheese, but whatever it is, I am addicted.  The go-to place for myself, my wife, or any visitor we have to the area, Peppino's is the spot."
1371,1,4.0,1,2009-01-27,"I've eaten here three times and I love it. I've only ever had the regular cheese slices but they're awesome. The cheese is gooey and the brick-oven gives the crust a nice smoky flavor. I only wish the slices were crispier, they are a little too floppy for my liking. Get the recession special, it's two slices and a soda for $5."
1372,1,4.0,1,2009-01-25,"Just had Peppino's for the first time, I'm ashamed to say. I've lived right next door to the place and have never been over there until tonight, but it was really good pizza. I had a pizza with tomato sauce, garlic, basil and capers (no cheese) and it was awesome.. can't wait to try the others. I got the small, which is 6 slices and I usually can put away a lot of food (see photo) but only ate half, all for $10. I will be stopping in for a full dinner one of these nights instead of just getting to go food - looked cool inside and a great neighborhood spot."
1373,1,4.0,1,2009-01-07,"They have a nice little computer set-up where it knows your number via caller ID, then pulls up your address. I just moved and to reward my helpers, I ordered some pizza. When they supplied my old address, I told them I had just moved that day. The man on the phone congratulated me and took the new address. When delivery came, Peppino's sent over 2 two-liters of soda on the house. Thanks guys!"
1374,1,4.0,1,2008-12-28,"Really tasty brick oven pizza with a delicious sauce.  I also love their sausage and peppers hero, though part of what I loved about it was that it was served on almost pizza dough-like bread.  The last time I ordered it, excited for its deliciousness, it showed up on a normal hero.  I was really disappointed.  That said, it was still damn good... just not as good.  Next time I'll call and explicitly ask about the bread. Their margarita and diavolo pizzas are both amazing.  I only wish I didn't get my weekly Peppino's hankerings consistently on Monday, the one day of the week that they're closed."
1375,1,5.0,1,2008-12-27,"Last weekend I ordered a margarita pie and the delivery guy brought two for me because they'd over cooked the crust on the first one (still delicious despite being extra crisp). I was so impressed that they gave me both and I had lunch for the next day...added bonus. Their brick oven gives the pizza a slight smoky flavor absent from most pizzas, setting it apart from the pack. The crust is wonderfully thin, toppings are plentiful and fresh. The pizza is perfect typical NY-style, great for folding. Yummmmmmmmm..."
1376,1,5.0,1,2008-12-23,"I eat here sooooooooo much.  And it's not because I am lazy and it is only a few blocks from my place.  If you are in the mood for Italian Peppino's gives you so many options.  Their Brick oven pie is the best I have ever had.  I have done the Grimaldi's and Lombardi's and I feel this pie trumps it.  Two pies in particular Pizza alla Vodka and the Diavola.  The ingredients are always very fresh and they cook the pie correctly so it is not flimzy.   Than there are the Heros.  The Chicken parm and Meatball parm are phenomenal.  The tomato sauce tastes like an old family recipe and we are lucky enough to enjoy it.  Also I think Pepinos is the only restaurant with this type of hero bread and they toast it in the brick oven too. The last thing I have had is the raviolis and you really can't go wrong with this.  Great sauce, fresh, and a good helping. I swear I am not a promoter for Peppino's but if you are in the slope do yourself a favor and don't wait in line for Grimaldi's sit down and enjoy a pie at Peppino's"
1377,1,4.0,1,2008-11-20,2 words: Quattro Stagioni.
1378,1,3.0,1,2008-10-26,"...despite a bad review I previously posted, I made another trip out here and was delightfully surprised. The service was friendly and inviting as were the pizza's. Thin crust was a bit soggy, but the flavors played in my mouth like a perfect concerto that would make any Salieri wannabe jealous. Brick oven and a family environment add great touches but the real hero is the pizzas. I'll make another trip out to try their pastas...to be continued"
1379,1,4.0,1,2008-10-17,"We LOVE this place. They have quite a few yummy pizza selections and the thin crispy crust ...makes my mouth water just thinking about it. It is expensive, yes, for a pie, but the taste makes it worthwhile."
1380,1,5.0,1,2008-10-10,"I just finished the ""Recession Special,"" a lunchtime deal of two slices and a drink (root beer in my case) for $5. I hadn't done my research in advance, so I was expecting just an average streetside pizza place. Not the case. The pizza was amazing--thin crust, crisp at the edges and chewy in the center, with the perfect smattering of black freckles on the bottom from the fiery brick oven. Just the right amount of cheese and sauce with a lot of real tomatoes, basil and oregano. Peppino's blows Joe's Pizza (a block south) completely out of the water. Service was quick and friendly, and it's only a block from my home/office and a few more from Prospect Park, which meant work picnic. This place is likely to become a dangerous lunchtime habit, at least as long as the recession lasts. I haven't been for dinner or a full pie, and it seems like the prices are pretty steep, so I'll stick to lunch for now."
1381,1,4.0,1,2008-10-02,"Really delicious brick oven pizza. I've ordered delivery, and it came piping hot and in a super timely fashion. At the restaurant, service was great and super accommodating, plus we got warm, fluffy bread which is always appreciated. Only downside: the pizza is hella expensive; definitely not what your average ""pizza night"" would cost."
1382,1,3.0,1,2008-09-10,"I haven't eaten in yet, but delivery wasn't great.  It tasted a little stale and bland.  It tasted like it could have been good if I ate it straight out of the oven though.  It's also pretty expensive... $15 for a small 6 slice pie."
1383,1,5.0,1,2008-08-04,"I'm torn about writing this review: on the one hand, I don't want word to get out that Peppino's is great, and make it all crowded. On the other hand, I think business is currently a little slow, and and I don't want the best pizza in Park Slope to go under. The pizza and sandwiches are both great. Dough is homemade, chewy, with a nice crispiness to the crust (obviously, it suffers a little in delivery, as all high-end pizza does. We ask for ours well-done when delivering). Most sandwiches come on bread made from the same dough as the pizza. Sauce is flavorful, chunky, well-spiced, and not at all sweet, which I hate. Cheese is very good, with actual flavor, as opposed to the rubbery fatwads lots of pizza places use. Toppings are high-quality, and they don't skimp. Is this the best pizza in New York? No. Is it the best pizza in Park Slope? Definitely. I hope you agree: just don't be sitting in my seat when I get there. : )"
1384,1,3.0,1,2008-07-16,"Went on a Tuesday night around 7pm.  We were the only diners besides one lonely guy sitting at one of the tables.  It didn't deter us from giving this place a try.  It's super clean in there with decent decor, which is a plus.  The waitress was also super friendly, another plus.  We ordered a small margherita pizza and one cheese steak to share.   The pizza was bleh, the main reason for the lower star rating.  I definitely would not order pizza from here again.  The crust was burned on the bottom but it wasn't crisp.  The sauce didn't have enough flavor and the cheese tasted a bit rubbery.   The cheesesteak was the highlight though.  Great flavor with a great hero bread.  I might go back for the cheesesteak, since I'm in the area a lot.  You still can't beat 99 miles to philly for a good cheesesteak found in NY though!"
1385,3,2.0,-1,2014-10-18,Pretty boring food and bad service: appetizers and entrees came at almost the same time. Would not recommend.
1386,3,2.0,-1,2014-03-12,"Food is creative and thought provoking - but make sure you eat before you go.  Portions are ridiculously small and left me feeling short-changed and hungry.  Had the celery oyster stew.  I know it's Brooklyn, but since when did potato and oyster cracker filler cost this much?  The stew scarcely covered the bottom of a cavernous bowl.  Conversation throughout dinner tended to echo off the exposed sides of said bowl. Heard every story twice.  Dekalb, maybe focus less on furbishing the walls of your restaurant, and more on furbishing the walls of my bowl of cheap-ingredient-yet-fancy-named-stew.  Probably won't be a next time. P.S. Semi-redeeming quality: Squash Tots.  Good concept, but ""squash"" becomes more of a verb upon meeting a fork."
1387,3,4.0,-1,2014-04-10,"Glad we found this restaurant. Unique décor is comfortable, eclectic and elegant. Wait staff friendly and attentive. Food original and delicious. Fried brussel sprouts were incredible. Rockfish in artichoke broth was wonderful. Can't wait to return."
1388,3,5.0,-1,2014-04-22,"I was in Brooklyn last weekend visiting family and we decided to try the relatively new Dekalb's Restaurant in Brooklyn, New York.  What a treat!  The menu is filled with dishes that are creative, economical, healthy, and most importantly delicious.  The wait staff was fabulous, especially Jamie, our waitress.  She was not just pleasant; she understood what was in each dish and gave us great advice about what to order to fill all of our different needs.  (We were a group of carnivores and  vegetarians. There were great choices for everyone. ) There was live music on Saturday night- and the way the restaurant is set up, we could hear the music, but it never got in the way of our conversation. We first went there for dinner, and wound up going back for brunch the next morning.  We never do that when in New York, but we had so much fun and the menu was so innovative, we could not help ourselves."
1389,3,5.0,-1,2014-04-22,The decor is so lovely and the menu fantastic. I especially loved the cocktail menu and the friendly bar crowd. The bartender helped us talk to everyone at the bar and really nerd-out about cocktails and specialty liquors. It was a really fun evening.
1390,3,5.0,-1,2014-04-18,"This is a fantastic restaurant - has everything - great service-oriented staff, delicious and creative menu and food presentation, boutique winelist w sustainably farmed options to compliment, and perfect ambiance, complete with local flavor and truly warm, neighborhood feel. Say Hi to Ras when you go, he's the best."
1391,3,5.0,-1,2014-04-16,"I am honestly overjoyed to have such an excellent restaurant on my block! Delicious and unique menu, friendly staff, plenty of vegetarian options and amazing atmosphere. The only recommendation I would have is that the seats are uncomfortable (although they look really cool) and could use some cushions. I am dumbfounded that another reviewer didn't like the veggie burger! I would say it is one of the best I have ever tasted... and I know veggie burgers."
1392,3,5.0,-1,2014-02-23,"I can't articulate enough how impressed we are with the food at this new establishment. I have found myself craving every dish I have consumed here the moment I have another opportunity to eat. Therefore we ate dinner their last night and then again today for brunch. The food is not the only aspect of this restaurant to gush over, the staff is warm, friendly, attentive and incredibly capable. The atmosphere is inviting and relaxed. The decor accentuates the environment with its reclaimed and repurposed materials. The beauty is in the details and their are so many beautifully executed details that you can feel the hard work and love that was poured into the place by the owners.   The food is the stand out, the executive chef really knows how to put a perfectly composed dish in front of you. The lamb was fork tender, paired with potatoes that were cooked lightly enough to still have the textural integrity needed to complement the silky lamb. The parsnip gnocchi, I prefer to call the parsnip pillows myself. Flawlessly toasted on the outside but light as air when you bite into them. The fried brussel sprouts are a must have, they have an indulgent quality about them that gets you thinking about the last time you ate a vegetable with such enthusiasm. The trout dish was exceptional, I don't often use the words ""rich and creamy"" to describe a fish dish but this one is the definition of rich and creamy. Peanuts boiled and pureed are the bed that an expertly broiled piece of trout sits a top. The skin of the trout is crisp and the delicate flaky white meat marry's together with the pureed peanuts in a refreshing and inventive take on your familiar seafood entree. The nice thing about the menu here is it's not a huge commitment. They have something that delights any mood or pallet you may be experiencing. The portions are appropriate to the cost which is so appreciated as a diner. You can easily share small plates or have just one entree and leave satiated. The current BYOB option gives you an opportunity to pair the food with what you acknowledge to be your preference in spirits. We have lived in this neighborhood for a number of years and are so pleased to see this new restaurant open in our area. With such quality food and comfortable environment its well on its way to becoming a staple in our daily routine."
1393,3,5.0,-1,2014-01-27,"I just moved to the area so I keep finding little things that really warms me up to my new home. Dekalb is certainly of those places a hidden gem. My friend and I were looking for places that would accommodate her special diet. Saw a sign for warm soup. From the outside look like all the other apartments near it just with a garage door not to far from the door making a slight difference. Well I'm glad they had that little sign up. We went in to find a warm place with warm colors of wood and the smell of fresh coffee just brewed greeting us with friendly people at the bar drinking from their coffee cups. A beautiful deity amazon woman with big hair greeted us and gracefully took us to a deeper area. A room completely made of windows ambient lightning and soulful music playing. I sat down on a church pew really feeling the sacredness of this place. We looked at the menu to find things that my friend could eat. I got the endive and she got the braised salsify to start. Then I got a almond stuffed trout and my friend got a vegetable burger. Followed by the parsnip yogurt dessert. The endive was savory and refreshing. I tasted the braised salsify assuming it would be salty but was happy to find a subtle sweetness. The almond trout was big enough for two people to eat but bc of this snow my appetite was large enough. The veggie burger she enjoyed saying she would come back for it again. The dessert was a masterpiece with the pyramid shape topped with a glass like caramel, a rare taste that wasn't overly sweet but just right. Got the check totaling $66 before the tip this had me and my friend nodding at each other yes we found our church of food. Usually food like this is easily $120-$160."
1394,3,3.0,1,2014-12-20,"Came for brunch; considering giving it another shot. Very good food, awesome atmosphere--really, but sloppy service. Other reviewers got it right by commenting on the potential, and I too feel that it's really just missing taking itself seriously enough. Our table was given a mix of current and outdated menus, so our vegetarian friend ordered an omelette from the old menu and ended up getting the current omelette with lamb. Pretty serious mix-up. And apparently, from reading past reviews, not the first time this has happened. Hope management gets its shit together. I'd really like to come back once (or if ever) they iron out the wrinkles."
1395,3,4.0,1,2014-12-08,"Updated review~~~~~~~ I had an issue with pricing and delivery, and the manager has since gone out of her way to rectify everything. Restaurants that go out of their way to make a customer feel welcomed back and fully satisfied is a sure fire way for the restaurant to make it in this city. I will definitely be ordering food from this place again now. Thank you for taking care of your patrons! Original review~~~~~~~~~ I ordered food for delivery for a second time to see if the other items were as good as the first time I ordered. I used Seamless to make the ordering easier, and that turned out not to be the case. I ordered the Banana Polenta Fries which are $8. I got a call from the restaurant shortly after placing my order, informing me that they were out of that and asked what I would like to replace it with. I asked  what else they had for the same price, and was told lots of items that were less, but nothing for the same price or even more. Finally I was told that the bread pudding was the same price, so that is what I ordered. Turned out, it was actually $3 cheaper, but my order was never revised and I was charged the more expensive price. When something like that happens at other restaurants, they normally offer an item that is the same $ or more. Never, and I mean NEVER, have I been offered food that is less $, and then charged for the pricier item. That alone is bad business practice. unfortunately that is not the only bad part of the order. The delivery guy called me from outside my building telling me to come down and get my food because he has a bike. Don't most food delivery guys ride bikes?Aren't they suppose to deliver food to the door, and not ask you to go outside to get your food because they have a bike? I'm upset about both items above, but charging me more $ for a cheaper item is extremely bad business."
1396,3,3.0,1,2014-11-22,"The decor and playlist were a cool. The food is good. The service however is seriously lacking. Over 20 minutes to get draught beer when there are only a few tables full? I really don't get it. Almost an hour to get our food, again it was relatively empty and another table that arrived well after we did got their food first."
1397,3,5.0,1,2014-11-09,"I saw this place on a walk to the Home Depot- was intrigued by the beautiful exterior. Returned later for dinner with my boyfriend. Staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was fabulous. We were both immediately charmed but also saddened by how most of the dining room was empty. We ordered from the small plates menu- the smoked trout, the pumpkin gnocchi and the brussel sprouts. All was delivered to our table promptly- fresh and delicious. The entire meal was punctuated by my boyfriend and I raving about how good everything was. Though we were full, we wanted to order more. So we'll definitely be back soon."
1398,3,4.0,1,2014-11-08,"Brunch, dinner, and drinks have all been amazing. I recommend the gnocchi, chickpea salad, sausage, eggs benedict, and coffee. I will agree with an earlier review about the service. All very friendly but kind of clueless. That won't keep me away but it's something to be worked on. Ask about the history about the decor. Very cool. Cocktails take awhile because the bartenders put their heart and soul into it. I admire the effort but it's not good during busy dinner shifts."
1399,3,4.0,1,2014-10-04,"Tasty food, stylish decor, friendly staff. I had the kimchi melt brunch. Came with home fries and small mixed greens. $9. It had good flavor and the portion was appropriate. Not too big but definitely filling. Will surely come back. This place is located maybe a block off the Nostrand/Bedford G stop. The neighborhood is actively changing, and there are plenty of nearby joints to check out (Dynaco, Black Swan, Project Parlour, Brooklyn Stoops, Colador Cafe) if you want to hop around."
1400,3,2.0,1,2014-09-29,"Meh... I really want to like it. The space is really beautiful and when we arrived for brunch there was a live guitarist. Music was a little loud for the echoing space but it was still nice. But the Eggs Benedict was so bland. For 12$ I don't expect brilliance but I would like to leave at least close to full and satisfied. It's been a long time since I've needed to add salt and pepper to a dish. If you are not going to plate your dishes in an interesting way, then I expect some amazing hollandaise that wins me over. I'll try again to support a new place but they need to find some inspiration and excitement. Take a look at Do or Dine (yelp.com/biz/do-or-dine-…) THAT is what food should look like when it leaves the kitchen."
1401,3,3.0,1,2014-09-07,"I waited to review this place till the third time I came to give it more chances to impress me... But it continues to lack fundamentally important aspects of a successful restaurant. The three stars is for the quality of the food and beverage, which I would actually give five stars because the chef really knows what he's doing, truly excellent fare. But the food is the only thing that comes out in a timely fashion. In a virtually empty restaurant, the staff is scattered about making no attempts to look busy, and if you order a drink, alcoholic or not, you won't get it for at least twenty minutes, and if you order multiple drinks (ie: coffee and water and a house made beverage) you'll get them each ten minutes apart. The service is always with a smile, but I can't tell if any member of the staff has any sense of what is going on or what exactly defines his/her job. This place needs stronger management and a better trained and hospitably aware staff to give it that little push that it really needs. Tremendous potential here... Excellent menu, atmosphere is fantastic, the decor is interesting and reclaimed and perfect, but seriously lacking attention to detail in all aspects of service."
1402,3,5.0,1,2014-09-03,"Went here for the second time. The first time I just had French fries, which were amazing. The second time, I ordered the lamb, chilled corn soup, and bread pudding. What an amazing meal. The soup was sweet with home made sour cream that tasted like heaven. The lamb was to die for. It sat on a bed of bok choi along with apricot sauce. One of the best meals I have had in a long time. I had two different bread puddings and they were warm and crunchy on the outside with cream on top. I also had some of their sparkling wine. The place is very clean and inviting. The servers are very courteous and attentive. It is definitely a diamond in the rough. I would highly recommend it and many compliments to their amazing chef, Damian."
1403,3,3.0,1,2014-08-30,"1) brunch food was good quality. Spouse had eggs Benedict and said the hollandaise sauce was good. I had the frittata -it was pretty flavorful. 2) bottomless drinks were a fail. This is why I give them 3 stars. Bloody Mary's are awful. Basically v8 and vodka. They tried to add spice - it did nothing. No kick. Nada. Go to Maggie browns or head into ft greene/Clinton hill. I asked for a mimosa since I couldn't bare the thought of another BM - they said that wasn't allowed?! Same price.  Both bottomless?? Eventually they gave me the mimosa. 3) the vibe is very Williamsburg. Service was nonchalant and blasé. Seemed like employees were predominantly transplants and out of towners who were too sensitive to direct questions that are commonplace in NYC . 4) Country music was playing. 5) Due to 2-4 above, will most likely not return. Sad because we just bought our first home very close to dekalb. Olea remains as ""our local spot""."
1404,3,2.0,1,2014-08-16,"Kind of a bummer. As the only game in town (immediate area) I had high hopes for Dekalb Restaurant, especially since at first glance it's a really beautiful space. The front room is what sells you: open and airy, big communal dining table, well kept bar. It feels very welcoming, like a European cafe. The main seating area is a bit drab since it's in the back of the restaurant with much less natural light. The service was average at best. The bartender glanced at us when we walked in and then ignored us until the servers reappeared. They were training a waitress when we visited, which is fine, but neither the trainer nor the trainee had much gusto and when I asked what the happy hour wine was they both seemed totally thrown for an answer beyond there being a ""red"" and a ""white"". Which brings me to the food, which was probably the biggest let down. The happy hour is a bit lame, $1 off two house wines and their beers, none of which I was terribly interested in. We came for dinner and ordered the gnocchi and the veggie burger. The gnocchi is a significantly smaller portion than other entrees and the flavors were confused and bland. There was what appeared to be deli mustard in the gnocchi sauce, which in addition to the gigantic slab of tough and chewy mushroom on the plate, was really not working. The veggie burger was gray, mushy, and flavorless. They also have no mayonnaise, which the burger really could have used and is in general just a little weird right? I would maybe give it another try for a drink or small bite, mostly just because sitting at the front communal table seems like it would be pleasant. Unfortunately, not interested in another dinner."
1405,3,5.0,1,2014-08-06,Excellent atmosphere. Unique and flavorful menu. Wonderful open air dining. Live music and exotic cocktails.
1406,3,5.0,1,2014-08-04,"Always a good time at Dekalb. The food is made with love and never makes you feel heavy. Also, Jamie is quite the baker and she can make vegan anything tastes amazing. Also, on the weekends you can find live music. The veggie burger is a big meal. I like the soup as well.   They used to have string bean tempura, that was heavenly. Check them out. Stephan the owner is super nice and you can find him sitting on his laptop in the front sometimes. His dad Mark is there sometimes too. He makes good drinks and knows his stuff. The drinks are hangover free :)"
1407,3,5.0,1,2014-08-02,"Delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. They could have filled the place with tables but instead opted to leave the front more open with one big dining table and room for piano and dancing The hostess said they do reggae dance parties on Sunday 3-10pm The food:   Great flavor, many options for solo eating or sharing -   Good value Wine options excellent too"
1408,3,5.0,1,2014-07-24,"I give this place 5 stars because they made me feel like they wanted me to come here and to like my experience. The wait staff was warm and comforting. The menu selection is not vast, but all the stuff seems good and interesting. I didn't try everything but it's got LOVE written all over it. It's a good place."
1409,3,3.0,1,2014-07-24,"Overall it's a nice restaurant. Cool atmosphere, interesting menu, nice addition to the neighborhood in terms of variety of cuisine, but the food was lacking. Many of the reviews here convinced me to visit right away, but I left feeling pretty disappointed. My date and I ordered the Asparagus Terrine, Gnocchi appetizer, french fries, and Lamb Tatsoi w/ apricot. The ingredients were definitely fresh, but needed a lot more seasoning. Overall the meal tasted very bland and we had to rely on the black pepper to liven up the dishes a bit. I understand that it's good to use salt sparingly, but the lack thereof really made these dishes extremely underwhelming. If this was the bland Midwest, I would have understood the lack of spices and flavor, but not NYC of all places. Also, from the pictures that I saw here on Yelp, the lamb dish used to come with brussel sprouts and parsney chips... Other times kale and a ragu. What I had last night was braised (more like pulled lamb) on a bed of fresh spinach with ONLY ONE pickled onion and a dab of apricot puree. Pretty boring. The server was nice and pretty helpful, but there was a guy playing the most annoying things on the piano before finally getting into ""enjoyable"" melodies 45 minutes into whatever practice session he was on. Not entirely sold on this place. I feel like this type of cuisine might be better appreciated by others, but just didn't do it for me or date at all."
1410,3,5.0,1,2014-07-20,Service? Yes. Food? Yes. Ambiance? Yes. Affordable? Yes. Just read a few reviews and went there to find this out. This place is a bit new and all I can hope is they keep their realness. Follow Brooklyn Food Porn on IG for more suggestions and check out this article on them. bkreader.com/2014/02/new…
1411,3,4.0,1,2014-06-26,"A new entry to a rapidly changing area of BedStuy, this restaurant is a patchwork of diverse materials and artifacts rescued from many locations around NYC. Interesting, unique decor. The service is friendly, the waitress was cheerful, warm, and very welcoming. The food was delicious, with generous portions of fries with my meal (I ordered the veggie sandwich with a slice of lamb on it). I had to knock one star off for the small menu selection. Hopefully the menu will grow and offer more items, but for now it's very limited. Also, they could do better with the lighting, especially in the table areas towards the rear. The lighting was a tad too dim and kind of depressing. Some warmer glows would help the ambiance alot. Overall, a nice place to go to when you're in the area and a welcome addition to the neighborhood."
1412,3,4.0,1,2014-06-14,"Adorable, chill place w live reggae band saturday night. Service was good though we went when it was pretty empty. Though menu was somewhat limited and a lil' pricey, both entrees were tasty. They were helpful in recommending and accommodating to my food intolerance/sensitivity. 1. Veggie burger w leeks and pickled onion jam 2. Gnocchi w mushroom"
1413,3,4.0,1,2014-06-14,"This restaurant is a fun and unique find. We went for a walk one evening and came across this place. The decor is pretty amazing, the food selection is incredibly unique and delicious. They have a decent selection of beer but a great bar for mixed drinks and wine. Highly recommend for a date night or evening out."
1414,3,1.0,1,2014-06-11,"Only place in Brooklyn I have been and not welcomed, recommend no one to go. Food is so so."
1415,3,3.0,1,2014-06-06,"So I have a bunch to say about this place...but first a disclaimer: as a native Brooklynite I have been exposed to so many restaurants come and go in this borough, I realize that I have become a bit of an elitist foodie (but only for Brooklyn dining). So please take my comments with a grain of salt: 1. The food really is good. We had the Parmesan sticks that we more like knishes without potato; the gnocchi, and the monk fish. Solid dishes! 2. The ambiance is real chill, filled with refurbished wood, steel windows from an asylum, and parquet floors. 3. But the service is a hot mess!!! The menu is not clearly divided up into apps/ small plates and entrees- you have to infer this info in the price; waitresses aren't able to speak to items on the menu in order to make recommendations; food is not timed to come out at the right times, so you are eating at the same time as your friends; way too many people work in the space and they just all step over each other and interrupt your dinner. It's a good space and I wish them luck, but I don't plan to go back until a few months pass and they figure their shit out- especially for the price they are asking you to pay for their carelessness."
1416,3,3.0,1,2014-06-06,"Very good food. Very creative and fresh. I had the veggie burger with lamb (definitely get it with the lamb if you are not vegetarian), and the Fiancé had the gnocchi. Gnocchi is definitely hand made and very rustic in taste. Sadly had to knock off 2 stars because of service. Don't get me wrong, everyone is VERY nice, but they all appear to be novices in the service industry. Waitress actually took my order and then ran off, forgetting to take my date's order along with mine. They just need to tone up their service skills a little and run a tighter ship. They should start with the pacing of food. Our food came out in 5 minutes. We barely had time to sip our first drinks, and as a result, did not feel the need to order a 2nd round. Generally a very nervous and confused energy coming from the wait staff. My wish for this place is that they become cool and suave with their service, making me feel like I want to spend $20 on an entree and sit and drink for awhile. It seems they are trying to be a fine dining experience in Bedtsuy, and they have the food and decor to back it up, but not the service skills."
1417,3,5.0,1,2014-06-06,"Absolutely die for this spot. Had the pleasure of sharing drinks with Mark (owner/consultant) on several occasions. I wandered in off the street on my first visit and felt transported to a Caribbean dream. The entire restaurant was decorated by Mark, himself, and contains pieces over a century old. Great music, people and oh yes, the food! Words won't do justice, you must go and order the menu for yourself. Live reggae, home made syrups and sodas and a backyard garden. This restaurant epitomizes why Brooklyn is the epicenter of our culture today. Go to Dekalb and feel at home in a place right out of a destination. Cheers."

1419,3,4.0,1,2014-05-20,"I went to Dekalb Restaurant for Sunday Brunch with a large party and I was very happy with the total experience.  The design and décor of the restaurant is comfortable and appealing.  We really enjoyed the live music which was not too loud, as has been my experience in other restaurants, especially if you're sitting close to the performers.  The price was very reasonable.  Between eleven people we had about 8 different entrees.  All of the food was presented attractively.  Two of my daughters ordered the Eggs Benedict and one, who is a bit of an Eggs Benedict snob, felt that they were not properly cooked.  In fact, she reviewed the restaurant on Yelp and only gave it three stars.  My wife, on the other hand, was thrilled with the consideration paid to my youngest son who has severe food allergies.  His dishes were specially prepared with attention to his needs.  She wanted me to get on Yelp and give it five stars to offset my daughter's three star review.  So, here I am writing this.  However, between my daughter's complaint and a couple of other small misses, I can't give the restaurant five stars in good conscience.  To me, that should be reserved for something pretty exceptional.  I had the frittata which I thought was very good, even if the potatoes were a bit bland. Would I go back for brunch?  Yes, but we don't go out for brunch often, so there are other places I want to try next and I may not be back there for a while.  However, I am looking forward to going back, probably for dinner next."
1420,3,3.0,1,2014-05-18,"Would really give it three and a half stars. Went for brunch with my family and we ordered a lot of different things. Eggs Benedict was overcooked...the eggs weren't runny at all, so if I went again I would specify. The blackened scramble was lamb instead of fish but the scallions were a little too powerful. Also, the food didn't come out all at the same time. But it was all plated attractively. The drinks were good and the live music was great! They were also really careful about food allergies and extremely accomodating. Atmosphere was great and so was the service. Would like to go for dinner."
1421,3,4.0,1,2014-05-13,This was the PERFECT place to take my mom for mother's day-- the food was incredible and I found the prices to be really reasonable (as far as NYC inflated prices go). I can't believe they opened in January and I've missed months of good food...
1422,3,5.0,1,2014-05-11,"Amazing menu, delicious food with awesome ingredients.  The ricotta gnocchi is a must try!"
1423,3,5.0,1,2014-05-04,"Dekalb Restaurant is a neighbourhood gem that hits all the right notes: great community spirit, lovely refurbished atmosphere, an incredibly friendly staff who all take the time to get to know you, and amazing food. In an era which is increasingly hands-off, it's nice to know that there's still pockets of community like this restaurant. We've been here for both dinner and brunch, and both times the food has been supremely outstanding. Dekalb specializes in the veg options, though there are still options for us meat-eaters (oh, how the tables have turned!). Prices are low, and though the portions are reflective of the cost, they're not absurdly Lilliputian like it can be in Manhattan. The best part, especially for someone that doesn't drink all that much, is that they have creative non-boozy -- the Bluestone (their take on a virgin Bloody Mary) is damned good for brunch, while the Brozost (lemon, thyme, and sparkling water) is a bubbly treat you need to have asap. As I've mentioned before, service is incredibly friendly. They are very much aware of the ingredients in their dishes, which is great since one of us does come with a strange food allergy. Don't expect to be rushed into decisions or eating by the service -- Dekalb lets you linger from beginning to end, all with smiles and thanks at the end of the meal. It's no wonder we're very excited that this place is only a few blocks away for dinner and weekend brunch, and I expect it'll be one of our neighbourhood staples shortly."
1424,3,5.0,1,2014-04-23,"I stopped in here yesterday & I was transported to a Euro vibe oasis. Mark was behind the bar and he is definitely quite the apothecary. Like my fellow reviewers mentioned, I was not rushed and was in fact welcomed like a member of the family. All the workers are local and care about the future of Brooklyn. They have a garden that will house their own home grown produce, which is AWESOME. The restaurant is made of old salvaged architecture and its definitely worth a snap or two. While dining I also met Ras and Stefan who are also a breath of fresh air from your typical restaurant owners. They also plan on having live music on Saturday and Sundays. Check it out, I feel there is more to come from Dakalb Restaurant"
1425,3,5.0,1,2014-04-22,"I absolutely love this place! Mark, the man behind the bar has a good head on his shoulders. Friendly, sociable and genuinely excited about what he's doing!  We only came in for a cocktail, and stayed for a few more than that. As a bartender, I appreciate the small but well selected liquor selection. Mark knows his products and you can tell he selected each one of them for a specific reason. The lamb looks amazing! I'll have to get it next time. In terms of the space, it's absolutely beautiful! I love it here!"
1426,3,5.0,1,2014-04-14,"After hearing so many good things about this spot , I decided to take my girlfriend to Dekalb Restaurant for brunch. Needless to say the food was amazing! Due to the fact that Dekalb Restaurant opened in January of this year, there is still a bit of menu restructurin. There were not too many dishes to pick from the brunch menu, however, each dish is outstanding. The polenta banana porridge is crazy good. Just a hint of banana that is brought out with The side muesli, and a nice savory edge with the egg and bacon side platter. The blackened rocky scramble also excites the taste-buds and is well balanced Loved the service and the whole feel of the establishment. Decor is very nice indeed. Highly recommended for all. It is also a family friendly establishment !!"
1427,3,4.0,1,2014-04-13,Great ambience and super nice staff. Came here for brunch and it's so relaxed and fun! The food is so simple but so delicious and full of really beautiful flavors. I will definitely be frequenting this place as it's a great neighborhood joint with class!
1428,3,5.0,1,2014-04-06,"To say Dekalb is a hidden gem in Brooklyn's Bed-Stuy would be an understatement. I had the privilege of dining there Friday night with some friends and from the moment I walked in the door I felt at home. Our server, Jaime, had extensive menu knowledge and was attentive without being overbearing. I had the mushroom ravioli and tried the lamb, the ravioli was a perfect blend of flavors and the lamb was juicy and tender enough to eat with only a fork. My party and I were graced with the company of two of the owners, Mark and Ras. While Mark told us jokes we were treated to a musical performance by Ras. This is a man full of soul who channels it through his acoustic guitar. I plan to be a regular here, at what will hopefully be a longstanding staple in Brooklyn."
1429,3,5.0,1,2014-04-05,"This restaurant is just delicious. A great addition to the neighborhood with a very unique menu. You will want to try everything! The food is cooked with love and you can taste it! I crave the fried brusslesprouts - a must try!!! Service is excellent, they are very attentive and knowledgable about food."
1430,3,4.0,1,2014-03-30,"Dekalb restaurant is amazing! Really great food and a relaxed atmosphere. Eat the lamb, the Gnocchi, the Polenta fries (!!!!), the brussel sprouts and probably anything else on the menu because it all seems great! Even better, Dekalb is BYOB for the moment so you can get out of there for very cheap. There is a well stocked corner store practically next door with some pretty good beer. Eat here, I promise you will love the food!"
1431,3,1.0,1,2014-03-26,"Truly disappointing. Like The Runner, Dekalb Restaurant devises a rustic menu with eclectic ingredients but fails the average taste test. Whoever made the veggie burger should be hog-tied and forced fed that uninspired mush. I'm not expecting Alice Waters by any means. The poorly executed farm to table concept leaves me craving a good old slice.  They need to reinvent their menu, rethink their uneven portions and lackluster flavored food, hire a writer, and get rid of the low seats."
1432,3,5.0,1,2014-03-23,"Nice brunch place for an alternative.  Beautifully decorated and extra friendly staff.  Had biscuits and leek leek gravy and Clementine ice cream and shortbread cookies.  Was really stuffed after all that but it all was good and will be back.  Anyone who is into things like sustainability, not wasting food, environment, etc will love the background of the business, which is use everything and make as much ingredients as they can.  With that said, the place isn't that expensive, atleast for a brunch.   And some of the employees like heavy metal.  That alone merits an extra star, but unfortunately Yelp only allows 5;)"
1433,3,5.0,1,2014-03-10,"I had a great experience here! I will start off with the cons to get them out of the way: - No liquor license, yet. But I'm not even sure that's a negative, because it was BYOB. So ... - The seating was a little low for me compared to the table. I'm 5'5"" ish and felt like a kid at the grown-up table. - Uh, that's it for the cons. The atmosphere is BEAUTIFUL, all low-lit golden glow and rustic-meets-bohemian sort of feel. When I was on my way there, as I walked by it I thought, ""wow, that place looks so cool, I want to go there"" before realizing that's where I was meeting my date. Even the bathrooms are mad pretty. My vegetarian date and I (it's a nice date spot) ordered like 4 things and split. I will try to remember what they were, although they all had a laundry list of exotic ingredients. Butternut squash tater tots (yummy although a bit greasy and fell apart....but like I said, yummy); parsnip gnocchi (GET THIS); kohlrabi kimchi melt sandwich (reminded me of banh mi); veggie burger. The portions are all smallish in size, but when we finished our meal we were full as heck. And trust, we ate it all because it was delicious. The service was so friendly and excellent! Once they get their liquor license and the bar in the front is in action, I think this place is really going to take off. You should go there before it's hip so you can say you already knew about it. It's a quick walk from the G. I have warm and fuzzy feelings about it."
1434,3,5.0,1,2014-03-06,"what a great place. very low key, good prices, incredible food. the atmosphere is formal yet friendly, excellent date spot. BYOB  for now"
1435,3,5.0,1,2014-03-04,"This is literally the first yelp review I've ever written - I've never been impressed enough  to bother before now.   Amazing food, gorgeously rustic space with a welcoming atmosphere and attentive and friendly service. The food was beautiful. Quality seasonal ingredients star in a healthy and innovative menu that  follows through in execution. Everything we tasted (most of the menu, because the prices allow or it!) was expertly prepared to showcase the ingredients with thoughtful additions and garnishes that added delightful bursts of flavor and texture to create a truly nuanced dish."
1436,3,4.0,1,2014-03-01,"Great food and fantastic friendly informative service. I'm vegetarian and the mix and quality of the ingredients and presentation was spot on, but don't let my vegemess dissuade you. The trout was 'excellent' according to my non vege dining partner. And every appetiser we had was a winner. Currently doesn't have a liquor licence so bring your own - we did , no corkage. Couple of tips - the entrees aren't that big compared to the appetisers, so consider treating  it like tapas and go for lots of appetisers or order appetisers with your entree. And the shortbread was the only disappointment - great flavour just not enough butter. Overall, lovely food, great ambience and super friendly interested and interesting staff. Had a great time and will definitely go back."
1437,3,5.0,1,2014-02-23,"First of, the decor: the repurposed wood, windows and furniture add amazing character to this space. It's a perfect Sunday brunch spot. The prices are good. Food was tasty and left me wanting to come back and try other things on the menu. The service is so welcoming and more than happy to answer questions about the space and surrounding neighborhood. I hope this place sticks around for a long time!"
1438,3,5.0,1,2014-02-15,"Amazing food- ham, melted leeks, banana polenta, was super great. Braised lamb could add some plain couscous,but super delicious with crispy kale. Decor is also super Brooklyn brownstone inspired, spacious, and almost church-like very warm. Can't wait for the summer when the gates open and the space will feel even more airy. They also have a garden in the back so fresh veges in summer will be nice too. Looking forward to it."
1439,3,5.0,1,2014-02-10,"Dekalb is amazing!  I feel like my words can not even do it justice, but I shall try...  The restaurant its-self is inspiring, made of all reclaimed wood, and the old hospital windows lining the ceilings and walls cause the vibes from the awesome band to flow throughout without being loud.  The Staff is friendly, and is eager to welcome you to the neighborhood.   The Mussels are served in a creamy salsify and leek broth, and the portion is generous.  I found myself looking for more items than just the grilled bread into the broth, at one point I think I may have just been eating it with a spoon. The Polenta fries, infused with banana, smothered in a leek ragout, and topped with crispy Serrano ham.....someone sure knows the way to a womans heart!  The perfect combination of crispy, creamy, salty, savory, and je ne sais quoi! The Lamb exceeded my already high expectations for it...fork tender, melt in your mouth, braised goodness!  served with perfectly cooked root vegetables and crispy kale which added the perfect texture to the soft lamb...ugh still dreaming about it 5 days later the panna cotta sort of blew my mind...now I graduated from culinary school, and I have experienced panna cotta quite a bit in top restaurants, even made it myself...but NEVER have I experienced a panna cotta this creamy, this rich, this.....addictive!  I have never been a huge fan of panna cotta, I could take it or leave it usually but the panna cotta with caramel 'glass'  had the texture of an insanely creamy cheesecake!! I can't even fathom how they managed to achieve this velvety, decadent mouth-feel but needless to say I will be back...to try every last item on the menu, hang out with the friendly staff and take in the good vibes!  The only downside of Dekalb is that I don't live in Brooklyn!"

1441,3,5.0,1,2014-02-05,"This restaurant is right up my alley. LITERALLY!! (Well, Walworth isn't exactly an alley, but you catch the drift). I work up the block on Willoughby Ave and it is super hard to resist popping in for a bite now. I went there on a date and all of the menu choices were different, appealing, and savory! Tried the mussels and ate them all. My date had the braised lamb. Little known fact: it is B.Y.O.B., so I brought a delicious Spanish Cider from Bed Stuy Beer Works and it was THE combo breaker for dinner."
1442,3,4.0,1,2014-02-01,"I ate here with my girlfriend last night and we both thought it was very good.  We split the fried brussels sprout to start and I had the almond stuffed trout and she had the vegetable burger.  This place definitely has its own twist on food with some unique combinations of high quality ingredients simply presented. Sort of like the restaurant  itself. Everything in the restaurant is salvaged - the floors are from some renovated building on the UWS, the backlit windows that surround the dining room like an atrium are from an old hospital, and the seats are church pews. And the staff is fantastic, and just very friendly and accommodating all around. I will definitely be back."
1443,3,5.0,1,2014-01-27,"Really good new place, great addition to the neighborhood.  The menu is a little different but super creative.  The food is amazing and all the ingredients are super fresh.  The decor inside is also really cool."
1444,4,2.0,-1,2011-01-18,"I was so excited to try this place out since it's only a few blocks away and looks packed whenever I walk by.  Holy schizza was I disapointed!  We went for brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon and couldn't wait to get our food since we were pretty hungry.   First off, my mimosa was lukewarm.  Second, my fries were lukewarm as well and tasted as if they were cooked 30 minutes ago.  The dining room was packed so I though the turnover would be decent and the food fresh.  The egg on my omelette was so thick and the egg:filling ratio was 3 to 1.  I had about 10 thinly sliced mushrooms in my entire omelette and a half inch pancake concoction of egg.   Now onto the service.  We lingered after meal over coffee and both eventually finished our cups.  I see the waiter walking by with a fresh pot of coffee and I'm already thinking in my head, ""thanks but no thanks"".  I didn't even get a chance to kindly pass a refill of coffee because he walked right by us to fill a lady's cup and went right back to put the pot away.   Maybe Le Parisien caught me on a bad day but mediocre food and below average service don't belong in NY.   On a good note, it's really cute inside and the decor seems tres french."
1445,4,3.0,-1,2014-06-01,"Came for Saturday brunch around 12:30. There were about 4 different groups there. Nice for a budget brunch. Options are limited but you definitely get enough food to fill you. We ordered omelettes so they came with a small salad and fries. The wild mushroom omelette was delicious, but not gonna lie, I was a little skeptical about whether they used real eggs or not. Fries were amazing! so we ordered an extra side. Coffee was average. Salad was really yum too. Staff was nice. Offered to refill coffee after we paid the bill. Checked on us. Very small place so do not come with a group. The rating might be on the low side but I would recommend it and go again if I were nearby."

1447,4,3.0,-1,2012-08-04,nice ambiance. quiet enough for a table of four to chat and hectic enough to enjoy the crowd of people feeling lively. reservation is 30minutes delayed because there was some confusion over the phone the night before. We ordered mussels which is pretty decent.
1448,4,3.0,-1,2011-06-17,"The food was good, but a bit too creamy for my taste..."
1449,4,4.0,-1,2014-09-17,"We had a lovely light afternoon lunch in an area where the choices are limited at 3 p.m. Since it was a quiet time at the restaurant, the waitress gave us lots of attention. It was expensive but worth it. The food was lovely."
1450,4,4.0,-1,2014-09-04,I love this restaurant! My friend booked a table last week for four of us. He looked up in yelp to make sure the food is good. And it didn't disappoint. It was a wonderful dinner. Ideal for small party and date. Definitly will come back.
1451,4,4.0,-1,2014-07-03,Went there last sunday with my gf. We both enjoyed the food - especially the carpaccio and also the mussels were delicious. Try the creme brûlée - it was fantastic!
1452,4,4.0,-1,2014-06-20,"Went on a Tuesday night for a belated Father's Day dinner. Everything we had was very good, nice size portions, you leave satisfied, but not stuffed. We had the pâté with cornichons (did wish it was more than 2 tiny cornichons) as appetizer, then the red snapper (special), and steak tartar. The wine was also very good, only drawback was that since they don't have a full liquor license, my Dad was left wanting for after-dinner cognac... The profiteroles and coffee made up for it nicely though. The place/tables are quite small, but it's quaint if you don't end up between two other tables, and we were lucky to get a table against a divider. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised, and would definitely recommend it."
1453,4,4.0,-1,2014-06-03,"We loved our experience here. Went for lunch and had fantastic food at really good prices. If you like French food, you need try Le Parisien restaurant.  I have to admit that this place is amazing. Le Parisien has a friendly ambiance and a local feeling. Good place for couples. Their food is fantastic and their steak frites are very hearty and filling. The service was stellar, 5 stars. Oh and did I mention the kitchen is CLEAN. Le Parisien definitely met my needs for some filet mignon.We had great, great time, will definitely have to come back here."
1454,4,4.0,-1,2013-08-05,"Nice little french bistro.  The food was fantastic and the service was great.  Took my mom and we had the escargot and I had the duck confit, which was delicious.  The portion seemed smaller but it was perfectly cooked."

1457,4,4.0,-1,2012-12-30,"Solid food, nice atmosphere, a bit cramped (but that adds to the atmosphere), and the staff are actually French, which lends a deal of credibility. A bit pricy, but worth it."
1458,4,4.0,-1,2011-11-28,"Had a dinner date here during the week - early evening.  My date was rather late, but we were graciously seated when she arrived.  I was so into her that I can't even remember what we ate (I think she had steak frites and I had trout) - the tables are a bit close together so conversation couldn't be too intimate, but overall, I liked the atmosphere and food."
1459,4,4.0,-1,2011-11-15,Lovely little french bistro hidden in Murray Hills.  We felt like we were truly in France/paris.  The staff paid excellent attention to us and the dover sole was to die for!!!!!!  Great wine selection.  Very small restaurant but just as cozy as it can be.  I recommend!!
1460,4,4.0,-1,2011-04-27,"I went here for a casual business lunch with a new client that I didn't know that well.  The authentic French staff and surroundings had us instantly swapping stories about different trips we had each taken to Paris.  Of course the glass of wine helped, and after a delicious meal (I had the sole, he had the steak frites) we got down to business over coffee and left the meal like old friends.   The credit goes to the authentic ambiance, attentive, but unobtrusive service and great food. I would love to go back with my wife for a romantic dionner sometime."
1461,4,4.0,-1,2010-08-06,"My wife and I recently found this little neighborhood gem.  It is a wonderfully simple restaurant that executes the bistro concept very well.  We have been back several times and enjoyed it immensely.  A simple but well executed menu, flavorful food and a nice selection of wines accompanied by genuine service.  What more can you ask for in a neighborhood bistro?"
1462,4,5.0,-1,2014-07-05,"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,   Ich und meine Frau stammen aus Ausland. Wir leben  schon über zehn Jahre in Bundesrepublik Deutschland und haben nie einmal gedacht, wie viel Ausländerhass steckt in manchen Deutschen. Aber dass deutsches Gericht diesen Hass unterstützt, hatte ich nie einmal erwartet. Ich möchte mich kurz fassen. Es geht um das Urteil Im Namen des Volkes des Amtsgerichts Schorndorf unter dem Aktenzeichen 6 C 327/13, verkündet am 07.11.2013. Die deutsche Familie H. (Kläger) hat die Ausländische Familie (mich und meine Familie  = Angeklagte) über Jahre als Verbrecher dargestellt. Eines Tages haben die Ausländer (ich) die Deutschen angefordert sich an der Wahrheit zu halten. Also, keine Lügengeschichten mehr. Die Deutschen waren  damit so beleidigt, dass sie die ausländische Familie (wieder aufgrund bewusst gelogener Anzeige!) vor Gericht gestellt hatten! Das Gericht hat bewiesen, dass deutsche Familie die ganzen, rein erfundenen Geschichten doch  nicht nur mündlich, sondern auch schriftlich jahrelang dar gelegt hatte. Auch dass die Klage auf einer bewussten Lüge basiert ist. Im  Prozess kam mehr aufs Licht, dies wurde aber ""aus Versehen?"" nicht dokumentiert, z.B. dass der Kläger mit dem Umlaufbrief sich beschäftigte um Ausländer zwangsläufig aus dem Haus zu vertreiben (also klare Beweise des Hasses). Dabei wurden diese Lügengeschichten als Grund der Zwangsräumung vorgesehen! Eigentlich, sollte es als bewusste,  jahrelange Taten gegen Ausländische Familie heißen. Was wurde der ausländischen Familie vorgeworfen? Nur das, dass sie gefordert hat diesen Taten das Ende zu setzen. Aber, wie denken Sie, wer wurde überwiegend (4.500,00 €) bestraft? Ja! Ausländer! Für das Gericht wurde es klar, dass die Familie H. in jedem Punkt gelogen hatte. Aber es war nicht wichtig! Wichtiger war die Frage: ""Warum hat Ausländer gewagt den Deutschen zu sagen, dass sie mit Lügengeschichten aufhören müssen? Dabei war das Gericht ohne Beweise (erste Sitzung) gerechter als mit Beweisen! (zweite Sitzung). (Auch ein Beweis dafür, dass die Beweise eigentlich keine Rolle spielen - die Ausländer müssen Verbrecher sein!)   In der ersten Gerichtssitzung hat die Richterin Verschlag gemacht die Gerichtskosten 1/2 zu 1/2 zu teilen??? Das hat der Kläger natürlich voll abgelehnt. Auf die Frage der Richterin, was erwartet man vom Gericht? Antwortete der Kläger: ""Es ist mir alles egal. Hauptsache Angeklagte mehr zahlt"". Und im zweiten Sitz wurde das Gericht zum Wunschkonzert des Klägers! Ich habe das Urteil des Amtsgerichts und Sachverhalt einem anderen Rechtsanwalt gegeben. Er hat erst gesagt, dass das Urteil sehr komisch sei und er wird mit Berufungsklage beim Landgericht Stuttgart  das Urteil widerrufen. Später war er sehr empört. Mir hat er nur eines gesagt, dass sie alle zusammen sind und wir erreichen dort nichts außer weitere 4000,00 € zu zahlen. (Beschluss Geschäftsnummer: 13 S 208/13 Aktenzeichen: 6 C 327/13 des Landgerichts Stuttgart). Ist es der politische Trend, dass man die Ausländer als Verbrecher darstellen soll? Also, deutsche lügen, sogar in der Anklage. Ausländer zahlen - so lautet das Gerichtsurteil. Damit wurde Hetzjagd aber noch längst nicht beendet. In der Eigentümerversammlung 2014 hat Herr Hausverwalter, vom Gerichtsurteil motiviert, gesagt, dass es, unter anderem Versperren der Kellertür usw. als Bote an uns gewesen war,  dass wir (Ausländer) in dem Haus nicht gewünscht sind und ich soll aufhören mich zu verteidigen. Was über mich und meine Familie erzählt wird, soll ich schweigend annehmen. Ich wollte wiedersprechen mit der Aussage: ""Aber nicht die Lügengeschichten..."" Und habe die Antwort von Hausverwalter erhalten: ""Wenn es euch nicht gäbe, sollte Familie H. nicht lügen""??? Hat Familie H. im Auftrag gelogen um zu zeigen wie schlecht Ausländer sein sollen??!   Also, scheinbar, immer öfter in Deutschland das Wort ""Ausländer"" automatisch mit dem Wort ""Verbrecher"" identifiziert"" ist. Damit wurde noch nicht das Ende der Geschichte gesetzt. Vor dem Gericht wurden nur böse Geschichten über Ausländer ausgesprochen. Jetzt kam es zu Erniedrigungstaten. Jetzt hat ihr Hass, vom Gerichtsurteil motiviert, sich weiterentwickelt - von Lügen bis zum Rechte weg zu nehmen.  Das Gericht, anstatt Hass zu bremsen, hat das Gegenteil erreicht. In der Eigentümerversammlung 2014 hat Herr Hausverwalter einen Vorschlag gemacht, der Ausländerfamilie ihre Rechte auf Gemeinnützige Räume  zu benutzen, stark zu reduzieren, im Vergleich mit den anderen Eigentümern. Auf die Frage, warum die Ausländer nicht gleiche Rechte haben dürfen, hat Herr Verwalter folgende Antwort gegeben: ""Die Frage ist richtig, die Ausländer haben das Recht, aber wen juckt das? Wir nehmen ihnen diese Rechte einfach weg.  (Protokoll Eigentümerversammlung 2014). Herr Verwalter hat auch gesagt, dass das Haus, seit Ausländische Familie  die Wohnung gekauft hatte, hat viel am Wert verloren. Früher wohnten im Haus nur die Deutsche, jetzt nicht"
1463,4,5.0,-1,2014-06-10,"This place is hidden gem in midtown. First of all, food is great. Steak Frites is my favorite. Their wine sauce on the steak is so good. Escargot is excellent. It was in shell with herbal buttery sauce. It tasted authentic just like I had in Paris. Second, Service is good. Staff was very attentive and extra nice. Lastly, they have a great wine selection."
1464,4,5.0,-1,2014-02-01,"I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, who enjoys the french kitchen. I went there with my girlfriend in January, i had a wonderful ""Mussels mariniere"" with a lot of taste, and an outstanding soup at the bottom. My girlfriend had a really nice ""Duck confit"", which she enjoyed very much. For dessert we shared a perfect ""Creme brulée"". When we return to New York, we would love to come back to this place, and enjoy a french meal. Besides the fact that the experience was great, it was also very affordable."
1465,4,5.0,-1,2013-11-22,"An unpretentious authentic French bistro on 33rd between Park and Lex. The dining room is small and relaxed with several booths and small tables, I don't think it could seat more than 30 total. .A lot of typically French signage and memorabilia. Service was very attentive.  Music was low and mellow.  It's difficult to find a relaxed place for a quick lunch this far up in mid-town.  Food as was described by others excellent,  if basic. and typical.  I had the onion soup which was delicious and the steak frites. Steak was cooked perfectly a point and frites were crispy,  salad was fresh.  The only other French bistro that compares food wise is Artisanal on which is a much larger, elegant and expensive affair on 33rd and betwn. Park and Madison.  Le Parisien is better for an informal lunch with a co-worker, artisanal is more formal and suitable for business lunches."
1466,4,5.0,-1,2013-11-16,"We are first time visitors to NY, and had a wonderful meal at Le Parisien. A small restaurant, with a very friendly vibe. Coq au Vin was excellent, as was everything else, including the nice conversation with the folks at the next table (one of the pleasures of a small restaurant)."
1467,4,5.0,-1,2013-10-25,"The most amazing food i've had in New York so far! I had the pate to start and the mussels for main- beautiful flavours and good sized portions. mum had a pear and walnut salad to start (she still can't stop talking about it!) and salmon for main. Service was great and the wine was delicious. 5/5, highly recommended!"
1468,4,5.0,-1,2013-08-06,"Great value for your hard earned dollars! Food was tasty, portions were generous and service was excellent!  If you are looking for a fancy French restaruant, Le Parisein may not be your choice. But if you are looking for real French food, unintimidating and real down to earth atmosphere, you must come here. We enjoyed all the 3 apeptizers that the owner recommended, escargot was served with real shells, duck confit was chunky and done well. I wasn't feeling too well, so I only had a French onion soup, the best onion soup I ever tasted, not salty at all, infact you can taste the sweetness  that came through with tons of sweet onion condensed in the base. My husband had the steak tartar. He said it tasted like what he had in France when he went there on business but bigger portion. My daughter had the Marseilles mussels, she loved it so much that she took the left over brooth home with her. Even the French flies were done to perfection, not greasy, serve up in an aluminum can to keep them warm (brilliant ) and you can taste real hand picked potatoes! For dessert, we absolutely loved the creme brûlée, very creamy and not too sweet at all. A must try! Service was excellent with just the right amount of attentiveness. We will definitely return again to try all the other dishes on the menu."
1469,4,5.0,-1,2013-07-22,"I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere was quaint, the staff are very friendly, and they had a nice selection of  food to choose from. I ordered the croque monsieur. It was very tasty and I enjoyed it a lot. It also came with a salad on the side.  The owners are French so when it comes to generating that French bistro feel, they know what they're doing. i will come back."
1470,4,5.0,-1,2013-03-20,Found this restaurant here on yelp. Superb service and food. Very small and direct service with staff. Food is excellent and at a good price for the quality. A definite find and somewhere I would return to.
1471,4,5.0,-1,2012-12-27,"My 3 previous reviews of this place have been filtered out by Yelp's obviously crude and poorly-tuned filter. I might jokingly say ""Help! I'm a prisoner in Yelp's program!"" I persist because I enjoy seeing whether honest human communication can survive in an increasingly computerized world. I find this the most comfortable and enjoyable restaurant in the neighborhood, lunching there once a week on chicken in a few forms or liver or portobello (the sandwich is a very nice construction) or papardelle with either Bordeaux, Malbec or Cote de Rhone. Mussels once in a while. In almost two years, believe it or not, only a single dish (cauliflower soup) failed to please me. Perhaps it is best that my reviews be censored because it is getting increasingly crowded at lunchtime. Happy New Year!"
1472,4,5.0,-1,2012-10-22,"I took a very demanding foodie friend out to dinner here and even he was impressed... Truly charming and relaxed restaurant with fantastic food and service. The goat cheese salad was delicious, the steak frites were cooked to perfection and the tarragon roasted chicken was full of flavor. A faultless Ile Flottante gave the meal a great finish. Wtih good wine to hand to set off the food and welcoming and attentive service, we had a great evening.  Excellent value, a truly enjoyable meal. If you want to be transported to the perfect French bistro without leaving New York, this is for you."
1473,4,5.0,-1,2012-10-02,Great little French bistrot  in Murray HIll. It s like being in  Paris.  I had the French onion soup and the roast chicken. Both dishes were excellent.  Service was very attentive and prices very reasonable. They are serving a $ 12.95 Prix fixe brunch Saturdays  and Sundays.
1474,4,5.0,-1,2012-08-14,"This place is a find. It is located a so close to my office, I don't understand how I never noticed it before. I picked it to have dinner with a very dear friend based on location, having a hankering for French and the reviews. Everything was delicious. We stayed for hours, no rush. Great food, great service. Can't wait to go back!"
1475,4,5.0,-1,2012-01-15,"Great food.  Very small place with maybe 12 tables, but was cozy. The French onion soup and the creme brulle were the best ever for me. My dining companions had the steak and frites as well as the escargots and were well- pleased.  Prices were quite reasonable for Manhattan.  Only negative for me was that they had only beer and wine.  So, I had to forego my pre-dinner martini.  But, the food and service were so good that I hardly noticed.t"
1476,4,5.0,-1,2011-11-04,"I had dinner there last night with my wife and it was wonderful,the food was excellent,the service impeccable,we felt like we were in Paris,we are going back for brunch.It's so worth it,you can't be deceived."

1479,4,5.0,-1,2011-01-14,"Le Parisien is what NYC was missing. An authentic french bistro. Period. The atmosphere is real (Christian, the owner, professional and friendly,  was born in Paris, and has worked in the best restaurants in NY for 20 years), the food is to die for and very affordable (classic dishes like escargots, frisee lardon poached egg, pate, soupe du jour, steak frites (home-made), confit de canard, etc... as well as creative dishes like a cod fish with mashed potatoes and black olives, skate with pumpkin risotto, moules frites with saffron, etc...). As far as the wines, you can either order a glass (10 different options), carafe or bottle. As a french native, i hardly recommend this new restaurant (opened last july and already packed). Also, great date place because it's cosy, and the music is very low, so you can talk ! Also, the $11.95 brunch is worth a cab ride if you don't live midtown. Bon appetit !"
1480,4,5.0,-1,2010-12-02,"I love this place. Great burgers, steak sandwiches, shrimp blt and great brunch!!!"
1481,4,4.0,1,2014-12-30,"Intimate warm setting. The mussels and crime brûlée were standouts although I did not crack the brûlée to my friends' expectation. I like creme brûlée, and like even more when autocorrect corrects it to crime brûlée, but I do not fold under other's demands of my creme brûlée breaking methods, regardless of the social consequences and specially on my birthday.  You'll like this place."
1482,4,5.0,1,2014-12-29,cozy atmosphere and warm and reasonably-priced food. perfect for a Christmas date. portion is also enough. not small. we had Le Parisien Salad - simple and fresh! beef liver - should have asked well done! half chicken - OH great! definitely go eat again.
1483,4,5.0,1,2014-12-28,Came with family while I was visiting place is small and quaint. Brunch deal cant be beat in the city.
1484,4,4.0,1,2014-12-24,"Staff are friendly and seated us promptly If the restaurant was advertised on Craigslist it would be described as ""cozy"". It's crowded and small but this creates it's own atmosphere and often end up speaking to the table next door. Definitely book. Turning up and expecting a seat will promptly have the whole restaurant turn to you, point, laugh and throw their unwanted scraps at you. The food is good, tasty but not incredible. It has flavor and creativity but its pretty much what you expect from the price range."
1485,4,4.0,1,2014-12-23,"Unpretentious Delight! There are so many world class restaurants in Manhattan competing for the diner dollar serving overpriced food overwrought with gimmicks that I'm almost expecting my Buddakan server to grace the table laden in 'flair'.  Enter Le Parisien. Located mid-town east Murray Hill (lots of legal street parking within 3 or 4 blocks P metered so don't forget to print, pay and display) in a tight space of 95% banquet seating (thus 4 stars not 5) although there is one sweet little table, on it's own,  right on the french door window in front if you prefer privacy. You can book this table in advance. The atmosphere is very European. No multi-million dollar decor.  The chairs are steel and wooden school chairs and the tables are rough painted and so perfectly adequate.  Waiter just friendly enough, owner stands on a raised bar surveying, pouring and drinking wine  presenting a menu of about 15 entrees all reasonably priced between $20-$26. The menu includes all the ""french"" classics as mentioned in other reviews-Steak Frites, Rainbow Trout ""Almondine"" and Duck Confit as well as some country dishes like Sauteed Calf's Liver and Pan Roasted half Chicken.  You can also order escarcot and creme brulee but step out of your comfort zone and try something different! For starters we ordered the Duck County Pate with Cornichons and the Endive Salad.  Pate was rustic and simply delectable. For the mains I ordered the Roasted Chicken. Don't let the ""half-chicken portion scare you.  Le Parisien are not buying huge growth hormone fueled chickens here.  The drumstick was only the size of those grotesque Hooter's drum wings making the portion just perfect. Served on a bed of simple mash, skin well seared and crisp surrounded by gorgeous fresh tarragon (used spot on sparingly) pan reduction and button mushrooms.  The dish came piping hot-because when you make unpretentious food that hasn't been fussed on my 6 sous chefs, that's what happens. Ordering roast chicken brings out the honestly of the chef-and chef didn't lie. The dessert was so so good I demand you order it! Haha but seriously. Ile Flottante- French slow cooked meringues floating in a devine creme anglaise topped with shaved and slightly salted roasted almonds.  Cry.  Perfection.   I can't rate this dessert against others of its kind because before that night I was a Flottante virgin and WOW what an orgasm!   Do not miss this one."
1486,4,4.0,1,2014-12-21,"I'm a huge fan of duck, and their duck is awesome--the french onion soup is amazing too! Overall the food is very good and the staff is nice, but the restaurant is pretty small; it can be a little tricky getting up."
1487,4,5.0,1,2014-12-15,Such a delicious gem in the city! Perfect for a date or a night out with the girls! Highly recommend the vegetarian pasta dish alongside a glass or two of pinot noir!
1488,4,4.0,1,2014-12-15,"Came here for the $15.95 brunch with 2 girlfriends. The place is definitely a hole in the wall but OH SO GOOD!! It has something charming about it. Our brunch was intimate, but only because they sat us babies in the corner. Anyone sitting in the middle shares space with other groups - unfortunate, yet very common in little gems in NYC. I had the poached eggs with salmon gravlax and my friends had the eggs florentine and the steak frites. We all loved our food. Also, our fat selves shared the french toast with apple compote - so good!! Would love to come back here one day."
1489,4,5.0,1,2014-12-13,Had a romantic brunch. Cozy spot by the window. Did poached eggs and salmon; great amount of food for the price.  Good service too. Planning on returning to try it for dinner.  Highly recommend this place.  Can't wait to go back.
1490,4,5.0,1,2014-12-08,"WOW! I was not expecting to find my new favorite restaurant when I walked into this small bistro. I ordered the soup du jour- tomato soup, the duck confit, and the tart tatin for dessert. Everything was phenomenal! The bread (we asked for olive oil) was perfect in the soup and alone. The soup was some of the best I have had and the duck fell off the bone. I have worked in a french bakery and eaten at a couple famous NYC french places and this one is truly amazing. Much better than the famous Balthazar! I highly recommend and will be back."
1491,4,2.0,1,2014-12-06,"Charming but crowded.  They have to move tables around just so you can get in and out of your seat.  Staff was nice and attentive though. Asides from being salty, small portioned, and overpriced, the food wasn't memorable.  I had the _ duck confit with some potato slices and withered greens underneath ($25).  _ French onion soup ($9) was okay.  Their _ apple tart was sweet and sour."
1492,4,4.0,1,2014-12-06,"Great food! We had artichoke salad, spinach salad, Steak, mussels and pasta and everyone was satisfied!"
1493,4,3.0,1,2014-12-03,"I really enjoyed Le Parisien, I just don't know if it's memorable enough for 4 stars. Let's call it 3.5 - my first ever half-star. Judging against the endless sea of options in NYC, if my friends booked dinner there, I would be happy to go. I probably wouldn't seek it out myself for a second trip back because I would rather try something new. Our table had the duck and the steak, and both plates were cleaned by the end of the meal. The service was at first a little pushy - came to the table to often and too quickly - then they eventually sort of left us alone. We were able to get a same-day reservation for Friday night at 8:45. It's a cozy little spot, probably around 15 tables, and while there were other people there it did feel a little private which was nice."
1494,4,4.0,1,2014-12-01,"charming spot, great food, friendly but professional staff was not prepared for how quickly the food came out---my only suggestion would be a breather before dessert  (floating islands---to die for!)"
1495,4,5.0,1,2014-11-30,"This place is a diamond in the rough.  It's one of the reasons why you should never judge a book by its cover.  At first glance, the place is really small with 2 person tables...and not many of them.  If you are a party of more than 4, I doubt they will be able to seat you timely because the place is packed.  Having said that...the food was excellent.  I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was delicious.  Perfectly cooked and served with a salad (which the French are known for) and delicious fries.  Service was extremely fast .  If you are looking for a classy elegant place....this place is not for you.  If you want excellent  food,  this place is a MUST!"
1496,4,4.0,1,2014-11-29,"Great food at surprisingly good prices! I like this cozy little restaurant, only thing I wasn't too fond of was the service. Not the worst I've received but definitely needs some work... Everything we ordered other than our mains - like bread and water took waaay too long and the waiter was quite unfriendly. Maybe it was an off day but everything else was great so I'll sure be back :)"
1497,4,4.0,1,2014-11-28,"Somewhat small space, so expect to get cozy. :) Fantastic food!"
1498,4,3.0,1,2014-11-23,"Great food, poor service.  We had a 7:15pm reservation but came early to find the restaurant empty.  We explained that our friends were meeting us at the reservation time but asked if we could sit down at a table, have a bottle of wine and wait. They were happy to oblige.  However, when our friends arrived (on time for our reservation) they came to the table to tell us that we would have to hurry up as they had other seatings lined up. (There were still empty tables in the restaurant, and continued to be throughout our stay). They then proceeded to rush us through the first course, clearing plates before we were all finished and serving the second course before we finished the first.  While the dishes were lovely, well prepared and served with style, the attitude of the staff really put a damper on our evening."
1499,4,5.0,1,2014-11-20,"Came here for a double date on a Saturday night. We had reservations for 6pm but we came a little earlier. We were greeted by a friendly host who sat us right away. We were surprised that the place was practically empty, however, that did not last long. In no time it was filled with people. It's a really cute, small restaurant that has a classic feel to it. There is a large selection of wine. They do not do cocktails but there is always wine! =D The prices were reasonable for good food, especially in the city. We started off with some delicious appetizers. We had the mussels in garlic and white wine sauce, yum! I do not usually like mussels but these were so good. The sauce was great. My friend and I split the baby spinach salad with goat cheese, almonds, tomatoes and some special sauce which was so fresh and light. For my entree I had the salmon. My friends had the pork, calf liver (YUM!) and the bistro steak. Everything was so delicious, we loved it all! So flavorful, fresh and amazing! Dessert followed, as if we didnt eat enough =x I had the creme brulee (YESSSSSSSS!!!!!) my friends had the apple tart and the floating island. Once again everything was great. Overall, we were really impressed and satisfied with the services, the food, and the atmosphere. Def recommend it. Will have to come back for the brunch special."
1500,4,4.0,1,2014-11-18,"I don't believe they do cocktails, I saw nothing but wine behind the bar. I did however have a nice glass of dry Chardonnay that was recommended by the waiter. The bread was kind of burnt and hard and the butter was too cold. The endive salad is literally the best thing I've had in awhile; roasted pears, Roquefort cheese, walnut, port vinaigrette... I almost ordered another one.The Escargots with herbs and garlic butter was good as well. I got the atlantic salmon with baby vegetable risotto and saffron sauce upon recommendation over the steak. The salmon was cooked perfectly as was the rice, however the vegetables were overdone and the sauce very nearly ruined the dish. It had this strange thick orange component, I couldn't really taste the saffron at all, I tried to scrap most of it off. Wish I'd gotten a different entree. Los profiteroles for dessert was solid, the chocolate was the right consistency as was the cream to puff ratio. Good experience, pricey though."
1501,4,1.0,1,2014-11-18,"Saw so many good reviews and was excited to try this place out. Went on a Sunday night around 8 pm and we were greeted by an INCREDIBLY rude host who came over to us and said, ""Yes?"" Errr. WHAT?! Excuse me, but you do NOT greet your customers that way. Then he asked us whether we had a reservation, and we said no. He told us the wait would be 30 minutes and ignored us, before we even said we wanted to wait. My girlfriend was so pissed we immediately walked out. How ridiculously rude. I will never support an establishment like this. No one deserves to be treated like this."
1502,4,4.0,1,2014-11-17,"Got here right at 12PM when they opened for brunch on Sunday. Thank goodness because by 12:30pm there was a wait Great food for $15.95 AND you get a coffee, OJ, sangria or Mimosa with your meal. Service was fast, prompt, friendly and food was out in a jiffy. Omelette's were simple and scrumptious. Croquette with ham and cheese on brioche was very soft and flavorful. My smoked salmon eggs Benedict was delicious. The best is that they serve you a side salad AND fries because let's face it, everyone wants a little of both! Overall, very positive and successful experience and I'll def. be back."
1503,4,4.0,1,2014-11-15,"I went in for lunch yesterday while searching for another restaurant in the neighborhood. The staff were very personable and funny, as well as attentive. I will definitely be going back!"
1504,4,4.0,1,2014-11-13,"small intimate lovely place. great food & wine. very kind and knowledgable hotsts. recommend escargots, steak frites and onion soup which was not salty and perfect for a chilly day!"
1505,4,4.0,1,2014-11-13,"One night, my friend and I were stressed at work and decided we needed a ""night in Paris"". So, we stopped by this place after our oh-so-stressful jobs. I was a bit worried because I hadn't made reservations but we were seated immediately, even though the place was full (it was a Monday night). First off, it's situated in a quiet part of the city - accessible by the 6 train. We ordered the mussels and the salmon. The salmon was cooked SO perfectly. I gobbled that fish up. It was on top of this really flavorful risotto with vegetables. That risotto was gone in seconds. The mussels itself were good (but not out of this world) but that sauce was ah-mazing! We kept requesting bread so we could mop that up! Deeelish. The average cost for an entree is about $20 so it is a bit expensive but it is French food after all. The service is a bit slow but they were friendly enough. I wish I had tried their desserts (I'm a huge fan of French desserts) but I was just way too full to do it. I will definitely come back though."
1506,4,4.0,1,2014-11-12,"One of my favorite spots in the city for a sleepy brunch. They don't open until 11:00, and the place is very small, but the Parisian vibe is really perfect for a homey cafe style with a friend of two."
1507,4,5.0,1,2014-11-09,"A quaint little restuarant.  Not too much seating so make sure you get there early. We got there and no one was there by the time we ordered no empty seat left. The food was delicious I had the duck confit with crispy potatoes and wild mushrooms. I ate it all, the duck was so tender the potatoes were cooked perfectly crispy.The desser was aesome as well I tried the Apple Tart and  Profiterole. I actually ordered the Apple Tart and ended up loving the Profiterole  so much more."
1508,4,5.0,1,2014-11-07,"The Pan Roasted Half Chicken and Braised Duck Leg were awesome.  The chicken was in a brown sauce, while the duck has a salty savory taste.  Both were crispy on the outside.  I also recommend getting a side of their fries. For desert, the profiteroles ice cream and chocolate sauce were to die for.  The ice cream had a vanilla flavor. The cafe americano and creme brulee were good, but did not stand out."
1509,4,4.0,1,2014-11-07,The artichoke salad is ridiculously good
1510,4,2.0,1,2014-10-29,"Four of us went for dinner.  Everything was edible, but not a single appetizer or entree or dessert was better than mediocre.  The service was neither rude nor gracious, but it was certainly not very professional.  I think there are many other French bistros in New York where the prices are similar and the cooking far better."
1511,4,5.0,1,2014-10-28,The first word that comes to mind is authentic.  Every time I walk into Le Parisien I am reminded of several of my favorite meals in Paris.  The space is small and the decor is a bit sparse but the service and food are truly outstanding.  Everything I have tried has been wonderful; from the french onion soup to the trout almondine and to the steak frites which is anything but basic.  I have been here several times and will absolutely continue to come back.
1512,4,4.0,1,2014-10-26,Had Calf's liver and Carpaccio. Both were delicious.
1513,4,5.0,1,2014-10-24,"Close to getting your Paris fix, lovely French décor in a cozy place. Very decent wine list and no more than 10 minute wait during a fairly busy dinner time. My escargots were not bad at all. Customer service was good. I enjoyed myself."
1514,4,5.0,1,2014-10-24,"This is really authentic French food and it tastes better than I remember it in France. It's homey and small, the chairs against the walls are not comfortable, but the food is delicious. Their house bordeux has a sweet finish which i am not accustomed to so i stuck with the malbec. Started with escargot and it tasted so good, it was drenched in butter. The smell from the next table made me order it and subsequently the smell from my order made the next table order it too! Take the bread and dip it in that escargot butter, it is amazing. I ordered the steak frites and the french onion soup. This is by far the best french onion soup i have ever had. the soup was salted and flavorful but not too salty and the onions were stewed to perfection, it wasn't super soggy from sitting on the stove way too long. it was so good, id go back just for the soup. the steak tasted stewed and ab it tough for medium but it was covered in the best wine sauce and the fries to go with it was just amazing. extra crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I arrived 40 minutes earlier than my reservation and the staff was so nice to me, they even let me sit down first and munch on bread til the rest of the party arrived and was patient to explain dishes to me. I will definitely be back!!"
1515,4,2.0,1,2014-10-19,"I came here today for a girl's brunch for the first time. We got there pretty early so we got a table right away. We all ordered from the Prixe Fixe menu which was $15.95 for eggs, salad, french fries and a choice of a drink. Overall, the food was pretty good, and the price was reasonable. However, there were a few problems with the service, which we weren't too pleased about, primarily because this is a small and crowded restaurant: When we ordered, we were told that we couldn't change anything on the menu, even if it was due to an allergy especially because it was so crowded. When we were all done eating except for one girl in our group,  the staff  kept coming over to ask if she was done eating and got more aggressive about it over time. By the 6th or so time, one of them even said ""Still not done?"" or something to that effect. Mind you, we have only been there for about an hour to an hour and half. I understand they are busy and want to move people along but people go out to eat to relax and to make us feel rushed is just plain rude. I might come back or recommend this place to someone just as long as they are quick eaters."
1516,4,4.0,1,2014-10-16,"Great find! What's with brunch places on 33rd and 3rd? So many, so good, so cheap! We came for the brunch deal of $15.95 for entree and drink. I got the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax with Sangria. Definitely recommend getting the Sangria, it's huge! A lot bigger than the mimosa that comes in a tiny champagne glass. The food was phenomenal. There was a lot of salmon. The poached eggs were just the right amount of runny. I really enjoyed my dish. Plus it comes with fries and salad (both average, but average is good!) Very pleased with the entree, and extremely filling. I'll definitely come back again. The only downside is how small the place is. Not good for groups. You will feel squished and you will probably have atleast a short wait."
1517,4,5.0,1,2014-10-16,"For a location so well located to all attractions and sights in NYC I am blown away by the price.  This location is very cozy, i would say unless you are a snob, which most people that come here are not you sit so close to the neighboring tables that it is almost impossible not to have a conversation or be engaged with them.  The bathroom is so close to the back that you almost feel as you walk there that you are working with the staff.  The staff is extremely friendly and energetic, there are some older staff but there is still a very good young blood hipster feel here.  This location is very French themed, very intimate small Paris dining, with the tables painted with the number and a need to pull out the table for people to sit.  I would say if you are looking for really fine dining this is not the location for you.  With that said if you would like amazingly good food and energetic atmosphere this may infact be the location for you.  Easily one of my favorite dishes of my life was the Duck Confet that i had here, it had a combination of flavors unlike anything i had ever eaten.  We did the French Onion soup for desert of course, it was really really sweet but still easily the best soup i have ever had.  My fiance had the steak, the fries were smaller sweet potato fries, the steak wasn't overwhelmingly delicious but still very good.  At the prices you can't beat this location, it is almost worth more considerations for most dining location in NYC as being a once in a blue moon for a special occasion and could be considered a place to go 2-3 times a month. Reservations a must as they are small and always busy.  Wine best deal by the bottle."
1518,4,4.0,1,2014-10-15,Steak frite is amazing. And def get the crume brulee for desert!!!! It's a real French brûlée :). Bon appetite!
1519,4,5.0,1,2014-10-12,"This place is so adorable and its one of the few places I will keep going back to. The food is very French, the wine selection is good and the service is stellar. Note that the place is tiny and there is little elbow room. You will not do well to bring a bunch of shopping bags."
1520,4,1.0,1,2014-10-06,"This place does NOT deserve 4 stars. The smoked salmon was old and tasted horrible, the English muffins on the eggs florentine were soggy and the omelette was greasy. The website made this restaurant seem upscale but it was cramped and shabby. There was one small toilet next to the kitchen. I trusted Yelp and wanted to bring my friend to a beautiful French restaurant for brunch. She was disgusted by it instead. Under no circumstances does this place rate 4 stars."
1521,4,5.0,1,2014-10-05,The space was tight but the food was excellent.
1522,4,4.0,1,2014-10-04,Decent little brunch place. Their $15.95 brunch set is sweet. Loved their sangria (hmm...) Pros: -$15.95 gets you a choice of coffee/OJ/mimosa/sangria plus an entree. Good deal! - they have around 8-10 entree choices to choose from (not bad) - both of our entrees were very large portions (my kind of style) - the food came out in less than 15min so it was perfect since we were in a rush -they have a small clean bathroom in the back -decent service Cons: -it's a small place so there could be a wait. We came at 12pm on Saturday and had no issues for two people -the lighting is a bit dark for my liking (especially if you sit more inside). We sat right by the window so had a lot of sunlight This is a cute place to have a quick brunch or a long brunch with a mighty good sangria.
1523,4,5.0,1,2014-10-01,"Very good food, reasonable prices, the ambiance of a french bistro."
1524,4,3.0,1,2014-09-30,Escargot: Average: buttery and garlicky. Country Pate: Lacked flavor Duck Confit: a little on the salty side but great with the mushrooms! Steak frites: YUM! amazing sauce and perfectly cooked.
1525,4,4.0,1,2014-09-25,"I can't wait to come back for dinner! Dinner for 2 seated promptly at 7:15pm (reservations via OpenTable). Small restaurant (40-50 persons), completely packed. We had a cozy booth next to the bar/cashier. Shared a bottle of Prosecco very reasonably priced at $39 ($12/glass). Overall the wine list is not so pricy. My friend ordered the STEAK FRITES ($24) - well sized portion, including a side of mixed salad as well. Cooked perfectly. I had the SKATE ($20) which was so yummy with the butter lemon sauce. Used a piece of fresh French bread to really taste it. Served over a good portion of perfectly cooked French beans. Entrees are pretty generous and well priced for the quality. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would be a regular. I look forward to returning and trying the entire menu and their specials - Challenge Accepted! (Def want to get the Steak Tartare and Duck Confit) Service was prompt in refilling water, refilling prosecco glasses and food seemed to have been served in under 15 minutes! AMEX accepted."
1526,4,4.0,1,2014-09-24,"I loved this little neighborhood French restaurant. Great food, wine and service. Really small and quaint. You feel like you are in France."
1527,4,4.0,1,2014-09-23,"Love this place. My hubby and I had dinner here and the experience was great! Reminded me very much of an traditional Parisian restaurant with ambience and all. We didn't need a reservation, the manager (I believe he was the mgr) seated us right away. He was very friendly and accommodating. Our server was nice and attentive as well. The restaurant is small and quaint, just like a traditional French restaurant in Paris. Atmosphere is warm and homey with classic pictures on white walls and candles lit on tables. It's romantic but you can easily go with friends as well. I had the pan seared half chicken. It was absolutely delicious! A great recommend. I had a glass of silky Bordeaux that paired well with my meal. My hubby had roasted salmon which was devine. It was more on the lighter side which was perfect and was exactly what he was looking for. I definitely will be back to try the steak frites and dessert (we didn't have room) when I visit NYC again. They looked amazing! I absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious French cuisine with great ambiance! Yum yum"
1528,4,4.0,1,2014-09-17,"Went here for dinner with a friend. It's really tiny, but cutely decorated and seating is very tight, so you can hear your neighbors conversation. It was busy for a Tuesday night! Luckily we had reservations. We ordered mussels, duck confit, and skate. Everything was delicious, your basic French fare done well. The skate was especially good! The presentation of the plates was very lovely and thoughtful. Service was a little hectic but there was only one guy manning all the tables. They serve a lot of wine to patrons so it gets really loud. But I would recommend this place if you want to feel like you're eating in a French cafe."
1529,4,5.0,1,2014-09-16,"OMG what can I say but the food was fantastic.  I am a French heritage American and love my basic cafe french cuisine.  Everything here was perfectly served well, clean surroundings and rather friendly french management. Looking forward to eating here again in November on my next trip.  Milles Mercis!"
1530,4,4.0,1,2014-09-16,Like your sitting in café in Paris.
1531,4,4.0,1,2014-09-15,I will definitely go back in the future. Ordered the steak frites and my friend ordered the duck confit. This petite bistro produce quality food with considerable prices. Suitable for cozy date or group of four.  The restaurant is pretty petite so make a reservation to secure the spot. Quality french food with reasonable price.
1532,4,2.0,1,2014-09-14,"We decided to try this place a couple of weeks ago based on the yelp reviews. Needless to say we were pretty excited! I had the eggs benedict and my husband had the wild mushroom omlette. The dishes came out really quickly but it was definitely not what I was expecting. The food was poor quality but I guess that's why the food is so cheap. Furthermore the atmosphere was unpleasant, they really try and squeeze people in here so the tables were way too close to each other and you could hear everyone's conversations. Ok, so it is New York and a bit of a crowd should be expected but there are plenty of great brunch places with more organized seating. Our server seemed very keen to clear our table.  Twice he almost took my plate, I'm a slow eater but if I'm chewing and holding my fork, that means I'm still eating mister! If you are after good quality breakfast/brunch food, don't bother with this place! There are great places in the village but if in midtown, Friedman's has better food options."
1533,4,4.0,1,2014-09-14,"Solid brunch food at very good price for NYC. No wonder they got good review and business. The place is small and packed. Even though we came around 2pm, we still waited about 10 minutes before seated. But once sat down, the food is served pretty quick."
1534,4,3.0,1,2014-09-07,"If I was solely rating the food, I would definitely give this place five stars.  My three girlfriends and I planned for a last minute Sunday brunch.  I literally live 10 steps away, therefore I told my friends to call me when they get there so that I would walk down.  Even though the place was pretty empty with maybe 30% of their tables filled, they refused to seat them until our entire party showed up.  When I showed up, we were still waiting for our fourth friend who got held up, therefore we told the host it would just be three so that we didn't have to wait standing.  He actually removed the fourth chair from our table which we then had to ask him to put back when our friend showed up exactly 5 minutes later. I mean come on, was that necessary? The waitress was very nice and the food was yummy, however the ""we are doing you a favor by allowing you to eat here"" attitude needs to go. Oh, and when we payed with four credit cards, instead of splitting the bill evenly, the waitress charged us all different amounts and did not even tell us. I mean, mistakes happen but just a heads up would've been nice. In summary, I can ignore bad attitudes/hospitality when I have delicious food on my plate.  Will definitely be giving this place another shot."
1535,4,4.0,1,2014-09-07,"Very reminiscent of the bistros of Paris or your average French town. Charming owners and great, moderately priced menu of bistro favorites. Nothing special in terms of decor (in fact, don't look too closely), but that is part of its charm. Packed to the gills with local characters from the Murray Hill neighborhood. The food was wonderful and the wine list was simple and inexpensive (just like in France)."
1536,4,5.0,1,2014-09-04,"I took my husband here for his birthday and we really can't wait to come back! We don't go out to Murray Hill much as it wasn't really our scene, but I loved, loved everything about this restaurant. I love how authentic it is. I love the cozy, bistro feel, and how everything is so tight you can barely move from one table to another. Intimate, one would say. I love that everything feels authentic. And you know what, they do one freaking mean steak frites! The fries are not greasy and perfectly crisp. The sauce on the steak was perfect. And the cook and temperature of my steak was perfect and consistent. I just have a preference that I like to cut my own steak, and they pre-cut the steak, but that's just a me thing. And absurdly affordable for the quality of the food they serve too! We are definitely coming back!!!"
1537,4,4.0,1,2014-09-02,They gave great affordable french food. Their service isn't the friendliest but their food makes up for it. They weren't too happy when we did not order wine. Their desserts aren't too great. Come here for the food. I had the special of the day and it was great. My partner had the duck confit it was delicious. I'm definitely coming back.
1538,4,2.0,1,2014-08-30,Local bistro fare is good. But what the two french fellas and the food lack is any joie de vivre. Perfunctory service and no humour or smiles. So may other places where they at least seem glad you are there.
1539,4,4.0,1,2014-08-30,"This place was close to a friend's apartment and we decided it looked like a promising last-minute brunch spot. We were seated quickly, the service was very good (were attentive without hovering, didn't try to push us out the door like they do at some places), and the food was excellent. I had the goat cheese and pesto frittata, which came served on a bed of fresh greens and french fries, and a mimosa. It was all delicious, and there was so much food that I could only eat half! Total cost: $14.95 (+tax & tip). The space is a little cramped, but if you're a two- or four-person group, it's not an issue. Great, relaxed vibe and quality food. I'll be back!"
1540,4,5.0,1,2014-08-27,"My boyfriend and I decided to have our date night here because we were in the mood for French food.  We were seated immediately (although we got there around 6 pm) and our waitress was attentive but not overbearing.  She also helped us decide what to order, which ended up being great choices--pan seared chicken with mashed potatoes and mushrooms, and parisienne mussels.  I'm usually wary of ordering mussels but we loved them-not too fishy, great texture, and wonderful broth with fresh vegetables.  The chicken was delicious too-it wasn't dry, was quite savory, and I picked it to the bone.  Mushrooms complimented perfectly.  Also, our waitress had us try the ""floating island"" dessert because we inquired about it, which I didn't end up finishing because it was too sweet for me.  She brought us creme brulee instead and only charged us for one dessert!  The only negative thing I could possibly say is that the bathroom was kind of icky.  Otherwise, it's a small, intimate setting that's perfect for a date and the price is ideal.  We will be returning."
1541,4,4.0,1,2014-08-24,"Le Parisien is a cute authentic French restaurant in Murray Hill. We went as a party of 5 for Sunday brunch which originally I heard was pretty packed. However when we went, there wasn't a crowd but we needed to all be present before we could be seated. We did the prix fixe brunch with entree and 1 boozy drink for $15. I ordered the Ham and Gruyere Omlette. It was very good but not anything special but it came with greens and french fries. The french fries were perfectly crisp but still had a bite. They definitely were the best part. The ambiance was very cute and the staff was authentically French (they spoke french with eachother). It's not the best with large parties since most of the seating is for 2 or 3 people."
1542,4,4.0,1,2014-08-20,We were the first at the door on a Sunday morning. Quaint little restaurant. Love the ambience! We had the poached egg with salmon gravlax and eggs benedict. Food came out quickly and was excellent! We stayed to sip our coffee and chat a bit but people kept clearing our table of everything on it and even attempted to take our unfinished coffee mugs. We hadn't been there long buy were asked to leave so that other customers could take our table. Maybe it's a New York thing? Would have been a 5 if it weren't for that ending.
1543,4,2.0,1,2014-08-19,"Eh. I probably went at the worst time possible: came here for Sunday brunch, waited like 40 minutes, was crammed into a table at a far corner. The place is not big to begin with, but it was so crowded and unbelievably loud, everyone at the table had to yell to hear each other. The food was pretty ordinary too. Not bad of a deal ($15 for a brunch dish) but the taste was was neither fantastic nor memorable. Nothing terrible happened, but the overall experience wasn't positive. There are so many better places in the city for brunch."
1544,4,4.0,1,2014-08-18,"Yes, I love this place.  The food is awesome.  Mussels are the best in the city.  Steak frites wonderful.  Salads are awesome.  Fair prices and great wine.  Excellent service every day from Anna.  But, Monday is a different story service from that young French fellow.  Talk about sounding arrogance, short and unfriendly."
1545,4,3.0,1,2014-08-18,"Neighborhood spot. Small, cozy, but not expensive.  Mussels (any of the soup variety) are always good w/ plenty of soup for you to soak up the juice w/ bread.  Good, crispy fries.  The soups, tartar, duck - all pretty decent. Friendly people."
1546,4,4.0,1,2014-08-18,Had a pleasant dinner here recently. Not too crowded on a Friday night. Shared the grilled artichoke salad to start. I had the liver and onions. Everything was well prepared and the service was great. Would definitely eat here again if we are in the neighborhood.
1547,4,5.0,1,2014-08-18,"My husband and I tried to make the lunch reservation but we couldn't get thru to make a reservation. Left frustrated after several attempts of calling, we gave up and we wrote to Le Parisien via Yelp to express our frustration with the relay call. Later, we got the call from the owner. He was apologetic and explained that he didn't realize that we are deaf customers.  He went far to get in touch with us by relay service and reserved our lunch time. That tells us that he truly cares about his customers! When we arrived at the place, the owner approached us and apologized to us again and welcomed us then escorted us to the table by the window. The dishes looked beautiful and artistic. We really enjoyed the food tremendously. The place is small but cozy. Our experience is quite positive! We definitely will return again! Thank you, Le Parisien for making our day so special to celebrate our first anniversary of marriage!"
1548,4,4.0,1,2014-08-16,"Went here for dinner. Having lived on French food for years I was craving something French. The steak frites hit the spot! Not like a dry steak but with sauce and caramelised onions. French fries were amazing. And my husband had the moules marinieres (mussels). Which were also really good. The waiter just did not understand/forgot to give the lid of the pot back after he emptied it of all the mussel shells. Service is perhaps for American standards a tad rude, but hey you're in a French bistro:) Tarte tatin could be a bit improved though. I have had better. All in all, forget your juice diet and enjoy their good food! Will definitely return."
1549,4,5.0,1,2014-08-13,"Great food, really cute atmosphere. Intimate setting, perfect for a date without getting over-the-top fancy."
1550,4,5.0,1,2014-08-12,"Great food, outstanding service. We came here the night of our engagement and have been back several times since and it never disappoints. Cute, tasty, affordable. Highly recommended!"
1551,4,4.0,1,2014-08-11,"Arrived here a quarter to twelve on a Saturday. There were about 3 tables waiting ahead of us. I had poached eggs with salmon & my husband had the croque Monsieur - they were both fantastic and you can't beat the 14.95 brunch pre-fixe which includes a coffee, OJ, or a b-fast cocktail. Can't wait to come back!"
1552,4,4.0,1,2014-08-11,"Great little restaurant!  Was thrilled to have made a reservation as at 8pm the place was bustling and it is not very big.  As others have pointed out - it's cozy but not cramped - relaxed and jovial atmosphere.  The menu is typical bistro fare with a few special items. I had a the steak tartare which was very good, flavorful but not overkill, and a tarte tatin which was delish! Totally affordable too!  We ended up paying $120 for 2, 3 courses, and 3 glasses of wine."
1553,4,4.0,1,2014-08-07,"I had an enjoyable brunch here; it has a nice, cozy, casual French cafe feel. They have a fixed brunch menu that includes an entree + your choice of coffee, sangria, or mimosa. There's a wonderful selection to choose from and I ended up having the Salmon Benedict, while my friend ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich. We both had a sangria each. My Benedict came with a side of seasoned fries, and my friend's sandwich was topped with a bunch of greens.. both dishes were overall very good! I would come back here for another brunch date."
1554,4,5.0,1,2014-08-04,"Food is awesome with big portions. We ordered mussels, and two main courses. Initially we also wanted to order two appetizers but the waiter has kindly reminded us not to. The mussels are very juicy, with smoked duck and tomato sauce, it's among one of the best I have ever tried! Prices very reasonable!"
1555,4,5.0,1,2014-08-04,"Cutest little french bistro in murray hill (of all the places!). We walked in on a busy Thursday night (after being quoted a 1.5 hour long wait at Cask next door) and were able to score a table immediately. I loved their wine carafes which were moderately priced and much less intimidating than ordering a whole bottle. Food was phenomenal. Literally everything we ordered was delicious to the last bite. But whether you get anything else or not, you must must must order the escargot. Holy moly.. I think I licked every snail shell clean! YUM!"
1556,4,2.0,1,2014-07-23,Had the duck liver pate and was disappointed. It was dry and just was not full of the taste that one would expect. Persons in my party complained about the steak being tough. Had the duck confit which was ok. Don't think the restaurant deserves the 4 star rating it has on Yelp
1557,4,4.0,1,2014-07-23,"My go to brunch for my neighborhood. Having discovered this magical place after being told of a 2 hour wait at Penelope, Le Parisien seated my friend and I no problem, and even gave us free mimosa refills since it was near the end of brunch hours. They have all the typical standard brunch foods but no place nearby can beat their French fries, these thin sticks of potato is fried to perfection. I'm sad to see the grilled portobello mushroom pesto sandwich off their brunch menu, but I did get to enjoy their amazing smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Hmmmmm yolkporn as my friend likes to call it. It was just what we needed. The place is small and quaint, so I'd advise to come early for brunches. I can't wait to go and try their dinner menu, everything just sounds so delicious."
1558,4,4.0,1,2014-07-23,"BRUNCH! Scrumptious, heavenly, all that is right in world with this new amazing spot I have just discovered! I have nothing but amazing things to say about this quaint gem! No reservations taken, but my brunch date and I walked in around 12:15 to find only 4 tables taken, but by the time we had gotten our drinks, and ordered, the place was packed. Things to Note As Pertaining to Ambiance: 1. Place is small, so if you want a table, come with a small party, 2-4 people, no bigger. If you are looking to bring a bigger party, pick another place, ideally speaking, or get there at 12 SHARP! 2. Even if you are a party of 2, still get there before 12:30 if you want to secure a table (they open at 12 for brunch). 3. Very intimate setting, you will hear the conversation next to you and a few other conversations in the area, and if you are claustrophobic I would avoid it as well. 4. The place itself, as I said, earlier is a quaint little spot in midtown, but secluded enough to miss the busy rush of the city feel. A little getaway, if you will. OKAY ON TO THE FOOD - Free brunch drink if you order an entree. We ordered the Sangria, which was good, although it was hard to eat the fruit because the oranges still had peels on them, which would be my only complaint. I would love this place EVEN more if they had a boozy brunch.... ALAS! I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict with Ham and Hollandaise sauce and my brunch date ordered the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax on English Muffins with Hollandaise sauce. We both, MULTIPLE TIMES, commented on how the eggs benedict, and salmon poached eggs just melted in our mouths, and dare I say it, THE BEST EGGS BENEDICT WE HAD EVER HAD! YES YES YES YES YES! IT WAS HEAVENLY and neither of us wanted it to end. And of course because we are both fat asses in our own right, we ordered the Fluffy French Toast with warm vanilla maple syrup with apple compote (which also ended up having bananas) - WHICH WAS FABULOUS, but as it was slightly burnt on one of the sides, and could have been slightly fluffier, but still really really delicious, I'm gonna -1/2 star for that. The service was great throughout the meal, helpful, yet unobtrusive, but I just thought the tables were a little tight and hard to maneuver around, even to get out of the booth, the whole table needed to be moved -1/2 star for little to no room, just felt cramped, esp after they seated someone basically so close to us that I could almost touch shoulders to the person on my left and right. Overall though great experience, and definitely come for the EGGS BENEDICT! Such a fan of this place, that I am putting it on my list to try for lunch and dinner sometime soon! TOTAL WIN!"
1559,4,3.0,1,2014-07-23,"Really cute and intimate spot. A friend and I had dinner early here (6pm) and were lucky to get the table by the front window so we weren't crammed in tight next to other tables. It got packed around 7or so and though the wait staff was friendly, I felt rushed. It's really small so the volume gets pretty loud and not really a place where you can sit for awhile to catch up with friends. We split the artichoke salad as an appetizer which was really nice - greens with warm roasted artichoke, cherry tomatoes in a lemony vinaigrette. Nice and refreshing. I had the special of the day - cod with cauliflower emulsion sauce and a side salad of roasted cauliflower. The cod was cooked very well but the sauce was a bit too thick and rich for me. The side salad was also salty. I tried a piece of my friend's skate and it was tasty. We split the apple tart with ice cream for dessert and it was just OK. Good that it was not too sweet but I was expecting more of a crust and it looked like it was just baked apples with some glaze on top."
1560,4,4.0,1,2014-07-21,food is pretty good. very hole in the wall place. my friend got the mussels and says it was amazing and he got double the amount of mussels he usually gets. so it was a lot of mussels. I got the chicken and it was delicious too though I was still hungry afterward. but I do eat a lot...
1561,4,5.0,1,2014-07-18,"My girlfriend and I were saying overnight in the Murray Hill area and we were looking for a place to celebrate some good work news. Although I found it a bit strange that she wanted to eat French food in NYC (as she is French and lives in Paris), we stopped by this cozy dinner place. We had a wonderful meal of moules marinière, steak frites, and tarte tatin. Very intimate setting with great decor and all the atmosphere of Paris on East 33rd. The only downside is that you can't eat outside and people watch."
1562,4,2.0,1,2014-07-15,"Went here for the second time and it wasn't as good as I remembered. Ordered the pasta, steak frites, mussel appetizer and two drinks. Overall just underwhelming. Total bill including tip came out to lil over 100$. Maybe people go because it's the only bistro in the area."
1563,4,5.0,1,2014-07-13,"Ahhhh.... Paris... city of light... and love. Wonderful anniversary dinner with the hubby. We have made our marriage stronger by coming to places like Le Parisien. It's not fancy, or pretentious... but it's obvious that this is where people come to indulge in fine French cuisine and libation. We shared a 1/2 carafe of 2012 red from Cotes du Rhone. Dry and delish. The ambiance is very low key and relaxed. (Just what you want when you've been married to someone for 7 years!) The menu was spectacular. Escargot cooked in parsley, garlic... and butter... if I could only order one thing from this place, it would be that and the crusty bread that accompanies it. For our main courses, we had the pan roasted chicken and the duck confit. The mushrooms and sauce on both these dishes were so good and flavorful! We had to be tacky and try the fries... I mean it's internationally known as the ""French"" fry... and they were so light and crispy and salty and downright tasty! Then we had to compromise on the dessert... Profiteroles with ice cream or the ""Floating Island"" (Meringue sitting afloat on vanilla bean custard.) My hubs wanted the Profiteroles and I wanted the Floating Island... but being our anniversary and my husband usually letting me have the dessert I want every other time we go out to eat during the year... I... ahem... I mean, ""we"" agreed on the Profiteroles... :) Surprisingly the waitress came out with both! She said, ""The Floating Island is on the house, Happy Anniversary."" Her name was, Ana, and she was such a sweet waitress throughout the entire meal... we were honored to be served by her... and I was personally happy that she eavesdropped on our lil dessert debacle. :) Both desserts were good, but I was partial to the Floating Island because of the textures and full vanilla bean flavor that they seemed to just ""pop"" in your mouth... it was also a little sweeter since it was an anniversary gift from them. ;)"
1564,4,4.0,1,2014-07-10,"I haven't had much French food, but their escargot was deliciously garlicy with a strong pesto flavor and my duck confit was juicy and fall-off-the-bone good.  I basically had to restrain myself from gobbling everything down in a matter of minutes.  However, the price to portion ration was a bit high for me, but I didn't mind quite as much since the food was good.   As a side note, the service was a bit spotty despite the restaurant being so tiny."
1565,4,3.0,1,2014-07-07,All I can say is that they must have offered decent food and service  - because one day later I couldn't remember what I ate or how the service was...
1566,4,4.0,1,2014-07-05,"I like this type of place. Small, traditional, great waiters, delicious food. Also centrally located."
1567,4,4.0,1,2014-07-01,Amazing all the way around!
1568,4,5.0,1,2014-06-22,"Best meal I had in New York. We order multiple dished including the chicken and the mussels. Everything was perfect. The best creme brulee that I have every had. The service was very good and it was packed. I highly recommend that if you are in New York, you must dine here."
1569,4,4.0,1,2014-06-21,"This is an adorable little restaurant in the Murray Hill area. We came here for brunch and really liked the ambiance and food. The interior is adorable, but it does get very cozy. There's not a lot of room here, and it would be difficult to get more than a group of 4 in here. It gets reasonably busy on the weekend, but not so much that there's a long line. The interior is decorated with vintage French posters and ceiling fans that give off a nice vibe. On nice days they open up the front so it's almost like dining in a patio, but be warned there is no air conditioning. They have a really nice brunch menu - most of the options are fixed price, and come with a entree and your choice of mimosa, OJ, sangria, or coffee (if I remember correctly additional glasses were 5$). The eggs benedict I had was delicious, and everyone else's dishes looked delicious too - the omelettes were plump but the salmon benedict really stole the show. Service is a little slow since it seems like they only have one waitress and one cook, but it makes for a nice leisurely brunch. Great, cozy restaurant with a very nice vibe!"
1570,4,4.0,1,2014-06-16,This is a great neighborhood staple. I've been coming here for a long time and everytime it's good. It dos get very crowded so I do recommend making a reservation.
1571,4,5.0,1,2014-06-15,Went there for brunch ! Salmon eggs Benedict is yummi ! It is a great quality and quantity for the price. They had good sangria and coffee ! Service is good and the place has an old European retro look ! The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they don't serve dessert on brunch.
1572,4,5.0,1,2014-06-14,"Went for dinner on Saturday night. The place is small and wasn't full,so I thought I might have made a mistake. The place looks like a Parisien bistro in Paris. We were promptly greeted and seated. The hostess/waitress/owner? was cheerful and knowledgeable and made us feel at home. We picked a wine which was a delicious rose. For my appetizer I had the potato roasted garlic soup which was delish.  My wife had the mussels which were simple and delicious. For entrees we opted for the liver (with an excellent wine reduction) that was cooked just right and juicy. My wife had the chicken which was also great. We both also had desserts. The deserts were simple good and expensive. All in all, simple delicious food. Reasonably priced except the desserts. Friendly and hospitable staff. I'd go back but get a dessert someplace. Still - 5 stats in my book."
1573,4,4.0,1,2014-06-03,"Excellent steak & frites!!! Very small place, about 6 tables in all and the food was delish!!! :) Will come again"
1574,4,4.0,1,2014-06-01,"Its really hard to find a good place to eat around the midtown/murray hill, so this to me is a great find. Its a cute, humble lil' bistro, so groups of more than 4 will find it difficult to find seating, however they do take reservations.  I had the french onion soup, and grilled chicken sandwich, while my friend had the croque monsieur (pretty big portion). The grilled sandwich was ok, but i was very pleased with the soup, came out very hot, and it turned out to be very hearty- highly recommended. The only negative thing i have to say is that the staffing is basically one waitress who is also the hostess.  They could use some help.  I'll be back though!"
1575,4,1.0,1,2014-05-30,"I was looking for a spot on short notice and was happy to find an open reservation at Le Parisien. I showed up on time a short while later and was told it would be a 30 minute wait with no apology or explanation. My guess is this was a failure to coordinate Open Table with conditions at the restaurant, but sorry, that's not my problem. If you can't properly hold a reservation, you shouldn't waste the time of your customers by taking them."
1576,4,4.0,1,2014-05-26,"Le Parisien is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood for brunch. It's only $14.95 for your choice of a brunch entree along with a beverage (mimosa, sangria, coffee, or oj). The fluffy french toast is my go to. It's topped with apple compote and bananas with warm vanilla maple syrup on the side. I'm also a fan of the scrambled eggs with cured salmon and chopped scallions. It comes with a small salad and fries. Their fries are thin and crispy and so good that I am always tempted to order another side of them."
1577,4,5.0,1,2014-05-25,"loved everything ... Duck is perfect. If I have to say something, I wish they have more dessert options"
1578,4,4.0,1,2014-05-25,"This place is tiny and the food is delicious. I had the thai mussels which were very good, several people in my group had other varieties of mussels and seemed to enjoy them. The mussels come with fries which I thought were too salty. The service was very good. My group really appreciated the free cocktails they let us sip outside since we had to wait a while because there was some mix up with our reservation"
1579,4,5.0,1,2014-05-25,"Thank you, Yelp, for helping me find this place!  Everything was delicious, the place was tiny & charming, & service good.  Who could ask for anything more?"
1580,4,4.0,1,2014-05-24,"This is a quaint little place in the Murray Hill-ish area. It was a nice surprise, with Parisian decor and little Eiffel Towers decorating the space. The quite strange thing, was that my friend and I were about the youngest people there...strange indeed. Let's move on to the food... escargot - deliciously pesto and buttery, and large! worth it, not over cooked in the least mussels espagnole - (with chorizo and tomato confit) delicious mussel pot served with frites, perfectly sized mussels and just the right amount of frites steak tartare - quite the portion size in the best way, the meat was fresh and the flavors were great...can taste the garlic, but not overwhelming, also served with frites creme brulee - the sugar crack topping could've been a little ""crispier"". it was good though. i only say this because i didn't hear the ""crack"" when my spoon broke through the sugar layer, great use of vanilla bean TLDR - great french restaurant with decent prices and good food."
1581,4,4.0,1,2014-05-24,"Best casual French restaurant in the city that I've had. Good for brunch, staff is relatively friendly, and the steak is done quite well. Does have that Parisian air and yet doesn't overdo it."
1582,4,5.0,1,2014-05-21,"I totally agree with all the other yelpers, indeed this one is a great find!! Every year around this time, my wife and I have this craving for typical french bistro food from our honeymoon. We have been looking for a whole in the wall, straight to the point, no frill french bistro food. Food was excellent!! It was as good as the one that we had during our honeymoon. So here's what we order: Escargot-on point, and excellent. I just wish for more french bread to soak up all the buttery, garlicky deliciousness...hahahahh (sorry...i'm a fatty who appreciates food!) Beef tartare- was amazing!! Seasoned on point! Steak frites-was so awesome, sauce was good. I asked for rare and guess what..i recieve my rare steak... Duck confit-was super crispy, a bit salty but thats okay you have the salad that counters it. After all the food that We ordered plus a bottle of 2011 bordeaux, the damage was less than $150 (tax&tip included).. Overall, when you're in NYC...give this place a try...my recommendation go during weekday and make reservation, like a said they're small... Bon appétit!"
1583,4,1.0,1,2014-05-20,"I ordered french onion soup, escargots and pork special of the day. The french onion soup was lukewarm.. Soups are supposed to be burning hot, especially french onion soup that is covered with cheese. Because it was lukewarm, the cheese was nowhere near gooey. Escargots were too small... They were legit the size of my pinky nail. The pork special was too thin and too sour because they put too much lemon and capers... I was really excited cause i thought i found a nice french restaurant, but this one was really really disappointing."
1584,4,4.0,1,2014-05-19,Small and cozy Parisian restaurant - a bit too small for my taste but it was still manageable. The mussels are a definitely must-try! They tasted fresh and flavorful with the garlic and white wine. It's a simple and classic touch that compliments well with the fishy-ness of the mussels. We also got the steak frites and an extra star for extra fries. Tip: make reservations! The place is small and it was packed on a weeknight!
1585,4,4.0,1,2014-05-19,"You definitely have to make a reservation at this place. A group of four showed up right in front of us and were turned away, luckily we had thought ahead. I like that you can make the reservations over Yelp. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny, yet they manage to fit a lot of people in it. This leads to some of the areas being very crowded, we originally were seated elbow to elbow with another couple, but the hostess asked us to move to make room for another party. While this was a tad annoying, it put us in a more spacious corner table. The decor is a lot of posters and pictures framed, once again the walls look crowded, I'm sure they could make the room look bigger with different paint, but they have tried with some huge mirrors that I liked. The vibe it gives off is more traditional than trendy. The dining room was a little bit loud, but not roaring or anything. We chose this place because the food was a bit cheaper, but still a nice restaraunt. I had the duck, and my fiance had the steak. I loved my duck, it was flavorful, tender, and the mushrooms and potatoes that came with it were delicious too. I hated the salad though. I only wish the piece of duck was bigger, like most places serve it. The steak seemed to be more about the marinade/sauce as opposed to a really nice steak. It was still tender, and it definitely was flavorful. Overall that was nothing amazing. The fries were nice and thin and crispy though. I wish that the dessert menu was more extensive, it had four things on it. We had to google the names of all of them. We ended up having something that was like a cream puff but with icecream. We loved it with the warm fudge. There was two puffs so enough for both of us. The reason it gets four stars instead of five is because of the small space, decor, mediocre steak, and the fact that our server rarely came back. There was only three people on staff, so I get it. But we felt like nobody was paying attention to us. :("
1586,4,4.0,1,2014-05-17,You cannot get a better deal that  brunch during weekends. $14.95 for great eggs Benedict with mimosa/sangria or coffee.  The service was really good. The place is small and a little bit outdated but good food!
1587,4,5.0,1,2014-05-17,"I am, admittedly, a total Francophile and am always looking for a French restaurant that makes me feel like I am in Paris - Le Parisien is it!  We love this charming little restaurant, have been coming for the last few years and never disappoints.  The food is always perfect - simple and authentic french, the service is great, wonderful casual ambiance and so reasonably priced for both the food and wine. Brunch is an amazing deal for under $15 including a mimosa and coffee.  There are only a few tables, so sometimes a little bit of a wait even with reservation."
1588,4,1.0,1,2014-05-10,"My family and I stopped by at this place for dinner around 7pm.  Upon entering there were a few tables open so we though we get a seat quickly.  The owner asked how many and I said three.  He then asked if I had a reservation, I said no then he proceeded to say that they were booked until 9.  So immediately I go to opentable.com and I was able to find a table for 7:30pm and made reservations.  After going back inside I told the owner that I was able to get a reservation, and he immediately instructs his staff to cancel the reservations because they were full. Since we had a kid who was with us (well mannered, I might add) the owner did not want to seat us.   If you were full why did you have a few open tables, and no one outside your door?  We were definitely discriminated."
1589,4,3.0,1,2014-05-07,"Had dinner with my girlfriend there couple weeks ago. We ordered the escargot for appetizer, calf liver and mussel for entree. Let me tell you why they deserve the 3 star. The food there was just so blend! The taste is just close to average. Calf liver was disappointing because the sauce completely covered up the natural taste of the calf. Mussel is ok, not impressive at all. With the food quality, it certainly did not deserve the high $20 price range. Most important of all, it doesn't really taste like friend cuisine, but more like American-want-to-be-French..."
1590,4,5.0,1,2014-04-29,"Food and service were both excellent. Couldn't resist trying all the classics: steak frites, french onion soup, and the creme brulee. The steak frites and the creme brulee were exceptional. Reservations highly recommended, as the place is tiny and very busy."
1591,4,5.0,1,2014-04-28,"Wow, great find, yelpers! I had a hankering for good french food at a decent price and this is what you returned for me! i made a reservation for 6:30pm on a Friday evening and when I got there, there weren't many tables taken. After my friend and I were seated, and handed our menus to review, I looked up at the place was packed! We started with the escargot, which was just as good as I remember it from Paris, and the garlic herb butter was perfect for bread dipping afterwards. For entrees, my friend had the duck confit, while I had the bistro steak frites. I liked the salad that the duck confit was served with. I loved everything about my steak! It was juicy and super tender, and even the french fries were perfect. To top it off, we had the profiteroles, which was a perfect way to end the meal with something small and sweet. It was a great experience and great meal. I'll be back :)"
1592,4,4.0,1,2014-04-28,Great neighborhood find. Had a delicious lunch. Will try dinner next time.
1593,4,4.0,1,2014-04-27,"If you face away from the street, you can pretend you're in Paris at this tiny brasserie/cafe.  A very authentic feel and delicious food."
1594,4,4.0,1,2014-04-21,"Great place to go for casual weekend brunch. Food is good and they have an excellent brunch deal consisting of a main dish + a glass of mimosa/sangria/coffee for under $15. It's a quaint little joint, not too shabby and not too fancy. Perfect place to go if you want to brunch in a more comfortable atmosphere and don't want to over spend."
1595,4,3.0,1,2014-04-15,"Stopped by for brunch on our way to the Little Prince exhibit at the Morgan Library. Prayed the wait wouldn't be ridiculously long. Got there and we were seated in two minutes. Saw the window table open up and the restaurant was awesome enough to let us sit there. Service was great. Food was your standard brunch fare but price was good - $14.95 including a mimosa, sangria or coffee. I'm never in the area so I probably won't go back but you should try it if you are in the area and don't want to wait a gazillion hours for brunch."
1596,4,4.0,1,2014-04-11,"Definitely worth going on a date night.  The couple who seem to be the owners are French.  That won me over because, after all, it's a French restaurant.  It's tiny, not fancy, and the food was just good not great. But I enjoyed the service and quaintness of it so much that I have to give it four stars.  And, like I said, most girls wouldn't mind being taken there.  I would go back."
1597,4,4.0,1,2014-04-04,"During a recent weekend in New York City, I wanted to find a nearby, authentic French restaurant for a romantic dinner.  Out came my yelp app, and 5 minutes later we were on our way to Le Parisien.   As someone who has spent time in the City of Lights, I can vouch for this place's authenticity.  I felt like I walked through the threshold into a quaint place in Paris for a delicious evening meal.  Give up any ideas of the matchy-matchy vibe at an American restaurant, and look forward to this place's unique and eclectic decor to welcome you.   Our meal started out with escargot.  They are always such a treat to get at a restaurant when they are prepared well, and the ones from Le Parisien are ones I would order again.  Both the texture and the seasoning were perfect.  The only problem I had was that there weren't enough in the order . . . I could have eaten twice as many as they served.  Next time I'll just get two orders.   Our entree was bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin.  Some restaurants over-cook pork, leaving me wishing I had ordered the other white meat.  The pork tenderloin at Le Parisien was cooked perfectly, and brought out of the kitchen piping hot.  I savored every juicy bite of it during my meal.  The portion size was also perfect for splitting, but please take into account my date and I are not huge portion eaters.  You may just want to enjoy this whole dish on your own if you order it.   I'll look forward to my next opportunity to visit Le Parisien.  @ bientot!"
1598,4,3.0,1,2014-04-03,"Le Parisien is a good standby restaurant.  Not bad, but not too good.  Very good service, and a small, but good wine list. I had a pear & endive salad and a roast chicken entry.  Both were real and good, but again, not great.   The main flavor I tasted on the chicken was chlorine, which is surprising because of the excellent quality of New York City water.   The restaurant is small and crowded by French and US standards (though normal by Italian standards) and a little loud, but still quaint.  The cloth serviettes are actually kitchen drying towels... Kind of interesting. I won't return, not because the food is bad, but because there are so many other better and excellent restaurants in NY City."
1599,4,4.0,1,2014-03-30,"Not the most beautiful restaurant you'll find but definitely a neighborhood gem. Le Parisien resembles a cute rustic French cafe. And for brunch, only $14.95?! Oh yes, please!!! Your brunch entree comes with either a glass of mimosa, sangria or a cup of joe. And them fries though... Crisped perfectly. Ahhhh, heaven! Worth the exploration if you're in Midtown East!"
1600,4,4.0,1,2014-03-30,The food was very good. I had the Thai mussels with fries and my husband had the steak and frites. Both were very good! We also shared the filet mignon carpaccio and I would DEFINITELY get that again! The actual restaurant was very small and very crammed but it didn't really matter once you got situated into your seat. The service wasn't really that friendly but I would go back for the food!
1601,4,5.0,1,2014-03-28,"What a wonderful experience! Made a reservation for 8.30 on Thursday night, we walked into a packed restaurant but they had a table open for us. The place is very small(most likely an old apartment) nothing fancy, but don't let that fool you. The food coming out of that kitchen is fantastic! We tried, filet mignon appetizer which comes with a little arugula salad, it was great. My fiance got steak and fries. I tried his meat and it melted in my mouth, it was also marinated(i think) so it was flavorful as well. I got duck confit - also very good but I would get the steak next time since it was divine! Desert was the most decadent creme brulee! to die for. Don't know about you but I am coming back to this place!"
1602,4,4.0,1,2014-03-26,"Cozy French restaurant - make a reservation and you'll get seated almost straight away. We got escargot, duck confit, and mussels. Good portions, didn't taste Americanized. Waiters/waitresses were attentive. Just that it could get a little cramped in there because the place is so small."
1603,4,4.0,1,2014-03-25,"Attentive owners ensured our glasses were never low and our bellies were perfectly full.  Just lovely.  Cozy environment, beautiful dishes (try the filet mignon carpaccio) and great crowd.  Will be back!  :)"
1604,4,5.0,1,2014-03-23,"We had a great diner, nice wine, amazing duck breast, and mussels Parisienne. Cute little cozy place, got full by 7 pm. Would recommend."
1605,4,5.0,1,2014-03-17,"A little on the pricey side, but the food at Le Parisien makes it worth it. I ordered the pan-seared half chicken and it was one of the most delicious decisions I've made recently. The portions were decently sized, especially compared to like restaurants. The ambiance was lovely and the restaurant was neither too loud nor too dark. Overall, great experience and even better food."
1606,4,3.0,1,2014-03-15,Very cute spot and good for a date. It is extremely small which makes it a date move. The food was pretty good. Definitely will go back eventually.
1607,4,4.0,1,2014-03-10,"Comfy & cozy, despite the tight quarters and crowd. Went for NYE 2014 prix fixe dinner. Food was better than expected."
1608,4,4.0,1,2014-03-07,The food was fantastic! The service was great and friendly bit with a rush. The place is realy small so it is a bit noisy when it's crowded.
1609,4,3.0,1,2014-03-05,"TL;DR: Skip brunch and come for dinner instead. Went for brunch at the behest of my girlfriend, but we came out slightly disappointed. Not that anything was wrong, but it was just really basic standard brunch fare with barely any French items (we got the Croque Monsieur and Egg White Omelette). Really wanted to like this place since its not too far from my apartment, but it was just nothing special! +1: With any brunch entree, get a choice of complimentary coffee (unlimited refills) / mimosa / OJ / sangria! It may have felt a little like Paris, but the food was just c'est OK!"
1610,4,3.0,1,2014-03-05,"Came here for my dad's birthday yesterday and left a little underwhelmed. We came here at 12 pm on a Tuesday and the owner didn't want us putting our bags on any other chairs. I mean there's no one in the restaurant. Is that necessary? We asked for bread and he would take it out of a big bag with his bare hands - some gloves would have been nice. To start, I had the broccoli soup which was a seasonal special and it came with truffle oil and wild mushrooms. Aside from the truffle flavor which I liked, the rest of the soup was really bland. I tried my brother's roasted beet salad and thought it was very tasty. For my entrée, I had the skate which was decent but the butter lemon sauce was super heavy and creamy. My dad ordered the steak frites and he really wanted it grilled like how they do it in France. However, this was more of like a stew the way it was cooked. My brother enjoyed his grilled portobello sandwich. Overall, I would say while the food was decent, I don't think I would return since it's extremely cramped and nothing spectacular."
1611,4,3.0,1,2014-03-05,"Finally made it here for dinner and I left disappointed. It's one thing to be in a cramped loud place for brunch, but it's a whole other story for dinner. My boyfriend and I were thisclose to the two tables next to us and it was loud and just kind of disjointed. I didn't feel relaxed during the meal and didn't feel like we really had the chance to catch up. Bummer! The food itself was just okay. I got the grilled artichoke salad and the steak tartar and my boyfriend got the French onion soup and the duck. The artichoke salad had a weird taste to it that I can't place and definitely didn't like. The artichokes themselves were yummy though. The steak tartar was eh. Maybe I just don't like steak tartar? I haven't ordered it in awhile. I tried the duck and that was really good. Should have gotten that. The wine was also good. All in all, I definitely won't be coming back here for dinner. Possibly brunch again, but only if its convenient. Sounds like they raised their prices on that too!"
1612,4,4.0,1,2014-02-25,"Lovely French restaurant with a great brunch menu. We came and were delighted to see the prefix menu~ brunch for $14.95. Done! We wanted to try something new. Live on 55th and Lex, hopped on and off the subway and wandered until we found this little treasure. He got poached eggs with salmon. I got the eggs Florentine. Both came with a spinach salad and french (ha) fries. The fries were perfect. The rest was pleasant. The mimosa was short and sweet. We came right at noon when we were the only people there. Within minutes the entire place was bustling with folks. Friendly staff. Clean bathroom. Food came quickly."
1613,4,4.0,1,2014-02-25,"One of the best kinds of neighborhood bistros you can find no matter where you live. One only wishes that their own version Le Parisien is across the street from them as a go-to dining spot that epitomizes reliability in quality and enjoyment. Not to mention extremely affordable. Excellent brunch options for under $15 is unheard of in Manhattan, and while other brunch destinations may leave you disappointed for their overhyped offerings, you know what you are getting here. Excellent egg dishes (florentine, omelette) and croque monsieur.  Dinner is your standard bistro fare done well. French onion soup, mussels, steak frites, duck confit are all quiet winners that leave you happy. Feel free to complement that with an extensive wine list which is also very reasonably priced. It is hard to call a restaurant with 4-star, 384 reviews underrated, but it certainly feels that way here."
1614,4,4.0,1,2014-02-24,"You know a place has solid food when there's a French 90-pound little old (money) granny in a massive fur coat gobbling down monkfish like it's the last meal she'll enjoy on this earth. Cozy French ambiance, excellent service, and if the food is good enough for French granny, you're damn well going to enjoy it."
1615,4,3.0,1,2014-02-23,"Overall, we had a nice time. The restaurant is very small, but the food and service were good. The beet salad is excellent. And the waitress was able to suggest a delicious bottle of wine. The steak tartare is decent."
1616,4,4.0,1,2014-02-23,Great poached eggs w salmon; nice ambiance; small but with lots of character. space is really cramped but that's not a big deal in manhattan.
1617,4,4.0,1,2014-02-22,Great food great ambiance. We couldn't get a table the first time because it's always packed. Make sure you make reservation ahead of time!
1618,4,4.0,1,2014-02-20,Great for brunch. Nice environment. Somewhat small for a big group of people. But the food is great. No complaint there.
1619,4,4.0,1,2014-02-20,Went with my college age daughter to celebrate her studying next year in Paris. Good move. This is a neighborhood bistro that serves very good authentic French cuisine. Attentive and friendly staff. It's pretty cozy so don't expect privacy. On the other hand our fellow patrons were friendly and contributed to the ambiance. Not pretentious at all. We'll be back.
1620,4,3.0,1,2014-02-20,Great little french bistro in Murray hill. Prices are very reasonable and food was pretty good. I ordered the moules for my family to share and for entrees we had the steak and Duck confit. Both were pretty good but not exceptional. The duck was a little dry and the steak was not very tender but both entrees were dressed well with a delicious sauce to compliment the meats. It was a good meal and had a cute french bistro vibe. I would definitely come again for a casual date but not for a special occasion.
1621,4,4.0,1,2014-02-16,"Cute and petite. I took my girlfriend there for Valentines Day and the place was decorated with red balloons and lit by candles creating a cozy and intimate atmosphere. They had a special 3-course prie fix Valentines Day menu for $49 per person from which I ordered a celery soup, a pan seared salmon, and a banana tart. Everything was wonderful, nothing too fancy, simply well cooked french food. We also ordered a carafe of bordeaux which was excellent. As my girlfriend and I sipped our wines, surrounded by walls plastered with vintage french posters, and listened to the waiters and waitresses speaking french in the background, it almost felt like we were spending our Valentine's day in Paris... if it weren't for some members of the staff asking ""FINISHED? FINISHED? FINISHED?"" every five minutes. I understand that it was Valentine's Day and they are very busy, but that is why I made a reservation. Please let us enjoy our meal in peace next time."
1622,4,4.0,1,2014-02-13,"Le Parisien Bistrot is a cute little French bistro, it reminds me of the Paris cafes in France. The restaurant is very small, but filled with a lot character. We went there for brunch with a group of people. The wait wasn't too long, and service is good. The eggs benefit was really yummy, the egg was perfectly cooked; the egg was running down the  ham and bread...so good. The french toast with vanilla maple syrup and bananas is esquisite! Loads of flavors and great pairing with the vanilla syrup and bananas. The Wild Mushroom omelete was alright, nothing spectacular. The steak sandwich is actually really good. This meal far exceeded my expectation."
1623,4,3.0,1,2014-02-11,Food was delicious here. Escargot is a must! Duck dish was pretty tasty too.
1624,4,5.0,1,2014-02-10,Delicious! We had the mussels (marniere and Parisienne). Much to my surprise they were very sizable portions. It might be easy to miss the door but once you're inside you'll feel warm and cozy.
1625,4,5.0,1,2014-02-09,"Food was great - ordered mussels, steak frites, and a bottle of wine for dinner. Ambiance - small restaurant, could get a bit loud. Service - very good."
1626,4,5.0,1,2014-01-29,"Le Parisien is the perfect little French cafe in a very American city. The place was small and quaint, with dim romantic lighting. The staff was very authentic in their French-ness, without exhibiting any of that infamous French attitude. I wouldn't even be able to blame them if they did, since my friend hadn't shown up till 20 minutes past our reservation. Now, when I say small, I mean you have to be prepared to share very intimate seating. The cramped space might have even added to the authenticity of the place. I like to think that perhaps the seating was designed with consideration of the slender and poised figures of the French, and not so much of the husky-bodied American. Regardless, you might have to shift your table around to get in and out, so it might be a good idea to use the restroom prior to getting situated. As for the food, it was DELICIOUS. My friend ordered the French Onion Soup and said it was a little bland, but that was her only complaint. She ordered the classic roasted chicken while i ordered the mussels with chorizo. Both were very delicious. I ended up forcing myself to physically consume the entirety of my dish even though it was huge. My body ached as i continued to eat past my limit, but i had no choice... my mouth overpowered my instinct, demanding i continue. I even went as far as soaking a few pieces of crusty brad into the broth of my mussels. Overall, my experience was fantastic. Will definitely be coming back for more."
1627,4,4.0,1,2014-01-28,I went last night for dinner. It's a tiny place with lots of character. You have to be okay with tight spaces - there's only a few inches between tables. The Skate fish was fantastic! I will be back again
1628,4,5.0,1,2014-01-26,"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat. I was in a rush, and only had a few minutes. Granted, the restaurant wasn't busy, but the food arrived super quick. The Sancerre as well as the food was excellent. Great portions; highly recommended."
1629,4,4.0,1,2014-01-25,"The deal for the brunch menu was awesome. $15 for drink (mimosa, coffee, etc) and a brunch item which comes with fries and salad. I thought the egg white omlette with salmon was pretty good. I am not really into fish, but the omlet itself was well cooked and seasoned. I loved loved the fries. Salad was pretty good too. The waiter seemed to be in a rush to get us out though. So I wish there was more time for the brunch."
1630,4,5.0,1,2014-01-22,"It's fantastic, nice atmosphere,  great service.  The mussels and the stack are amazing.  Tried the brunch , it's great and they have a good deal for it"
1631,4,4.0,1,2014-01-17,"Excellent. I can add little to positive comments that have been said before. The nonchalant server approach is pure French and should not be misread. This is Bistro style French cuisine at its best. With about 12 tables reservations are recommended. Try mussels, duck confit, salads and Floating Island desert. Short wine list but well selected...try the Sancerre!"
1632,4,4.0,1,2014-01-12,"What a charming French bistro! We stopped by on a week day after failing to get a table at another place nearby. We saw a full house and a decent wall of wine so we had to step in. This bistro has a charming quality to it: quaint enough to let it be a date night without giving the impression of ""trying too hard."" The seating area is pretty small, especially since one end of it is wall-to-wall glass. You may rub elbows with the party next to you. We tried the Bistrot Steak Frites with Red Wine Thyme Sauce with Shallots and the Duck Confit with Crispy Potatoes, Wild Mushrooms and Frisee Salad. Both dishes were delicious and components fresh. Steak was cooked perfectly and the duck confit was tender and flavorful. Overall, a pleasant surprise in terms of food and ambiance."
1633,4,4.0,1,2014-01-10,"Great place but small. Really good food. Had the duck, beet salad, mussels. Came here after the movies at kips bay. Pleasantly surprised."
1634,4,3.0,1,2014-01-09,"The food and wine was all delicious. We enjoyed two fantastic entrees and a delicious profiterole dessert. My only criticism is that the waitstaff was a bit off-handed. My friend and I are in our early twenties, and it seemed like we were being talked down to for asking about wine recommendations, favorite desserts, etc. All in all, we would definitely go back, but not for the service."
1635,4,4.0,1,2014-01-04,"Truly good french food, for a (for new york) reasonable price. This is the kind of place you bring that special family member you want to impress :D"
1636,4,5.0,1,2013-12-27,We picked this restaurant based on yelp. The escargot was as good as what I remember from France. My husband ordered the mussels and received a HUGE pot of mussels. They were really good and he filled up because there were so many. He said he never expected to fill up from an order of mussels - it happened. I ordered one of the nights specials - coq au vin - it was superb! Also a big plate; I ate until I just couldn't anymore. A very quaint restaurant. Get a reservation as there are not a lot of seats. We will definitely be going back here!
1637,4,3.0,1,2013-12-27,"Great neighborhood French bistro, with friendly service and a cozy atmosphere.  We shared the endive appetizer (loved that they cut up the pieces very well), the duck confit and the mussels (can't recall the name, but first item on the mussel menu).   The duck was a bit overdone ... I like it when the confit is a bit tough to chew, but it was very flavorful.  The mussels were very fresh, but perhaps needed to cook longer, as the onions were still a bit raw. Overall, yummy food and a nice pleasant dining experience!"
1638,4,5.0,1,2013-12-26,We had our xmas eve dinner there. It's such a cozy place to hang out with friends and family. Nice food and affordable. Recommend.
1639,4,4.0,1,2013-12-24,"I loved this place. Great food, nice ambience. The owner seemed to have much pride in the quality of the food they provide. Recommend!"
1640,4,5.0,1,2013-12-22,"Le Parisien is not posh, but is absolutely perfect for what it is - really great food and very friendly and helpful service. The menu contains basic French bistro food, and it was all very well executed. Fantastic duck confit. While in NYC we went to fancier places, but none less memorable. We'll be back."
1641,4,4.0,1,2013-12-13,"Went to Le Parisien for a date last night and this restaurant definitely lived up to it's reviews!  Everything we had was delicious.  The escargot was very tasty and presented very well.  The pot of muscles (garlic and white wine) was an extremely generous portion.  The steak frites were cooked exactly as we had ordered and had a delicious, rich red wine flavor.  Even the wine was surprisingly better than expected. The restaurant itself is very small and has a cozy atmosphere.  We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated right away.  The only negative on the night was that our table was within two feet of the door, so each time anyone came or left, we felt a huge gust of wind.  Besides this (which was tolerable as the restaurant was packed and we did not have to wait) the meal was essentially flawless. Will definitely be back to Le Parisien!"
1642,4,4.0,1,2013-12-12,Pretty good food.  Great ambience.  Good service.  This is a fun neighborhood spot that is definitely worth a try.
1643,4,3.0,1,2013-12-10,"i would say its more like 3 1/2 stars.  really difficult to rate this place. I'm mixed with rating the service.  the waitress was really confident with the food and will not recommend anything because everything is "" great"".  oooookay.  she was really nice about me sitting there for a while waiting for my friend who was late without making a big deal out of it. thank goodness it was a horrible snowy night.  the waitress was efficient and checked in on us regularly which was nice.  I can see how this place can get too overwhelming because of its tiny space and the many patrons.  we ordered the escargot, pate, bistrot and frittes, fish special in a bouillabaisse and duck confit..  as expected : tasty escargot. my friend loved the pate.  i enjoyed the duck confit though really tiny portion.  just a small piece of the leg but great flavor. i don't mind it being a little dry but some people may have issue with this. i happen to enjoy the crispiness of the skin when I go to duck.  the fish special was fine but did not blow my mind though.  though the steak had a great authentic flavor but would have preferred a better cut of steak since I was chewing it longer than I would like. should have ordered the steak tartar looking back.  the atmosphere was really nice and I can see how people say it reminds them of Paris. just go when you know it won't be too crowded."
1644,4,2.0,1,2013-12-09,"I came for lunch and had an omelette and coffee.  Neither was good.  This place came highly recommended from a good friend whose taste I trust so I would give it a second chance if the opportunity presented itself, but I'm in no rush to make a second reservation."
1645,4,2.0,1,2013-12-08,it was my birthday and they did absolutely nothing to make me feel happy/special. they were fine aside from running about 20 minutes late. they're french in attitude and service. the food is good. this place is certainly overrated.
1646,4,4.0,1,2013-12-08,"So much better than expected. And, dare I say it: so much better than current state of bistro fare in Paris itself. The bread was terrific -crusty on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside. We both had the soup of the day which was an excellent squash soup laced with dark green streaks of extra virgin olive oil. I thought it was a little under-salted but my husband didn't (and we are usually on the opposite sides on this.). I had the mussels in white wine and garlic which came with plump fresh mussels in a terrific broth (the bread came in handy once the mussels were gone -mmmm) and good skinny fries. My husband, who'd just come back from Paris, had ""pan roasted"" chicken with string beans and potato puree. He loved it. He said he'd tried four different times to find this meal in Paris but, unlike years past, had not succeeded in finding it. We will definitely go back. The restaurant was small (and the tables quite close together) so reservations would be smart. They apparently have a prix fixe brunch on both Saturday and Sunday we know nothing about but seems like it might be a good deal. (advt price was $14.95)"
1647,4,5.0,1,2013-12-07,"I made a reservation for 2 at 5:45pm on a Wednesday night, since all the previous reviews recommended I do so. We were the first in the restaurant but it quickly filled up moments later. It's a small place, but not stuffy and quite affordable. There aren't many restaurants I would return to, but this is one of them. There is a giant chalkboard at the front with a selection of wines by the glass, 1/2 liter, and bottle. Steak tartare came with a raw egg in a half shell and french fries. Duck confit came with crisp, out-of-this-world potato slices. You get your greens here too. Food was amazing. I was in the zone until he said, ""Bebe... you ate all the duck..."" I looked up, mortified, and could only respond pathetically, ""...but I gave you the last potato..."" There will be more duck. I guarantee it."
1648,4,5.0,1,2013-12-06,"good food, quiet, small, neighborhood french"
1649,4,4.0,1,2013-12-06,"I had an excellent dinner here with an out of town friend. Delicious food, large portions, reasonable price, relaxed & cordial service, charming decor. I'll definitely return!"
1650,4,5.0,1,2013-12-02,"Charming, reasonably priced with great service."
1651,4,5.0,1,2013-12-02,"Definitely surpassed my expectations! The food was good the service was great. My favorite us the soup and calves liver. Of course, calves liver is an acquired taste. The waiter came back occasionally to make sure everything is alright and made sure they didn't disrupt our conversation. The place is really small though, so make sure you make a reservation!"
1652,4,5.0,1,2013-11-30,"My wife and 2 kids went here on a Monday. As most others mentioned, we needed reservations. There are maybe 4 tables for 4 in the entire place. The decor really does put you in mind of Paris. A little cramped, but fairly quiet, just enough sound to give the feeling of energy.  The waiter was patient in explaining some of the menu and wine selections. Service was quick, appetizers were out within about 5-10 minutes of our order. I imagine that they  need to be efficient to turn tables in such a small place. I had the filet mignon carpaccio, really was tremendous, cut paper thin but packed with flavor. My wife was pleased with the French onion soup.   Entrees again pleased everyone, I had the duck confit, definitely 5/5, perfect seasoning and tender/crispy texture. My wife and son went with bistros steak frites both were happy, I thought it was 4/5 , just a little of burnt flavor on the outside., but very tender and the frites with red wine sauce were wonderful.  I tried my daughter's pork tenderloin, also outstanding flavor (wrapped in bacon) and very tender.  Desserts stole the show. The creme brule was 'the best I ever had' according to my wife, who has quite a number  in her life.  The shallow ramekins helped to balance the crunchy/creamy elements.  My daughter wolfed down the profiteroles in no time flat, I didn't even get to sample it. My son was really into the apple tatin, and he's not even a big sweet eater - the apples were caramelized to perfection, with flavors from other fruits developing from the apple.    Just as pleasant an experience one could expect to have in Midtown Manhattan."
1653,4,5.0,1,2013-11-27,"Thanks to a Yelp reviewer I found a gem in the Murray Hill area.. Actually Leslie D.s review was the key! Thx you Leslie we loved it. We began w/ a nice Cote Du Rhone.....Chapelle St. Arnoux. A nice red not too dry wine recommended over a drier Bordeaux....you can find that wine at a number of online store....excellent !  I had the country patè....and we split that along w/ a rare filet from the appetizers. We also shared the white wine/ garlic pot of mussels ....very traditional. As an entree that we could have split either, I had the Duck Confit over potatoes and mushrooms and Lynne had the grilled trout over risotto w/ lime......OK, we kinda sampled the menu....LOL...this restaurant only seats a bit over 30. We loved it! That was Mon. night the 25 of Nov. our food was delis .......a crusty duck outside and perfectly moist and flavorful inside. I did taste the trout...I liked it as did Lynne. So, what was fab...the pate....mussels...oh well everything....and esp the mussels and wine....paid the bill, grabbed a cab and on to see Van Morrison at Madison Sq. Garden in the theater .....yay!"
1654,4,4.0,1,2013-11-25,"First time for French food was a great experience! Had dinner here the other day, and have to say their half chicken with wild mushrooms and mashed potatoes is one of the most delicious dish I ever had. Escargot was a new taste too. Wine Steak and frites were decent though. I like the ambiance and coziness of the little restaurant, and prices were reasonable for French cuisine."
1655,4,4.0,1,2013-11-25,"Went here last night for dinner for the first time and it was pretty fantastic! I live in the neighborhood and was looking for a new place to get dinner before a movie  I'm so glad I found this spot. It's quite small  tucked away on 33rd St btwn 3rd Ave and Lex, but the ambience is part of its charm. You feel like you've walked into a true Parisienne cafe, it's very romantic, small dining room. Our table ordered a bottle of wine which and French onion soup (traditional and delicious), the beet salad and artichoke salad, both beautifully presented and fresh and very tasty. For dinner we had the roasted chicken (with the most crispy skin on the outside and juicy meat on the inside, yum!). The only thing we ordered that was not a perfect 10 were the Parisienne mussels, surprisingly. Not much flavor, very little broth to dip our bread and perfect French fries in. Everything else was fantastic! We will definitely be back for the brunch special they have on Sat. And Sun!!!"
1656,4,4.0,1,2013-11-20,"Magnifique. ! The salads we had, roasted artichoke and endive with pear, were perfectly dressed.  Mussels were delectable and the rarely found as such, skate, was sublime.  So many restaurant s in NYC, but this one is worthy of numerous return trips.  Did I mention the creme brulee? Perfect."
1657,4,5.0,1,2013-11-18,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday... What a treat! I live in the area, and have always had trouble finding something that is in Midtown, not packed with tourists, reasonably priced and charming. Is it really too much to ask? The store itself is quite small, seating is limited. However, I was seated immediately at 12:15pm on a Saturday. The lighting was just right, and the just the right amount of staff presence for a lovely girl (or romantic!) date. I ordered the egg white omelette with gravlax and herbs from the brunch prix fixe menu ($15.95 if I remember correctly?), which includes one drink of choice (coffee, OJ or sangria). Best egg white omelettes! Unlike the huge pillow of mushy bland tasting egg white that I usually get (at Jane, for example), this egg white was first flavored with herbs and then made into a ""pancake"" form before being wrapped around a very flavorful piece of salmon. I wish I could make these at home for breakfast.. and lunch.. and dinner... There was no whole-egg-envy :) Would definitely go back, especially with such reasonable price and convenient location. One of my new favorite brunch places... Midtown, or not!"
1658,4,5.0,1,2013-11-18,What a great little date spot! This tiny little French bistro is hard to get into without a reservation but once you're in you'll enjoy authentic French fare in a cozy atmosphere. I had the steak frites and my husband had the lamb ragu special--both were excellent and perfectly portioned.
1659,4,5.0,1,2013-11-16,"LOVED this place! It is such a cute authentic fancy cafe looking french restaurant. The mussels (thai style) were just ok. I think I like my regular italian style mussels better. The frites were crispy and salty (just the way I like). The duck confit was AMAZING, with the tender duck meat and crispy skin, I could have eaten 10 servings, had a heart attack and died happy. WORTH IT. The Bistrot Steak Frites were TO DIE FOR. Well, I skipped the frites since I had it with the mussels. Instead, I had it with a mixed green salad (which was standard spring mix with whatever dressing they use.... But for some reason it was also really really good). It must have been the sauce. Not only was the steak ""melt in you mouth"" tender, the sauce was so good that, even though I ate everything on my plate, I wanted to ask for a container to bring the sauce home! I was considering trying to cook steak that weekend and pouring the sauce on it..... Or just drinking it for dessert. I LOVE THIS PLACE."
1660,4,4.0,1,2013-11-13,"Fantastic dinner! Highly recommend this restaurant! Great food, great ambiance, and great time!"
1661,4,4.0,1,2013-11-09,"Unequivocally French. Very well curated wine list, laid-back atmosphere. There were so many mussels in the pot, I am shocked I finished them. Frites were fresh cut and delicious. Great little French go-to!"
1662,4,4.0,1,2013-11-06,"Within walking distance of Pod 39, I tried Le Parisien and was not disappointed. Authentic and intimate, the food and service were first rate.  Shared a salad and totally enjoyed Steak/Frites with a terrific sauce - cooked perfectly and the prices were quite reasonable by NY standards. I'll go back next time in NYC. Bravo! Vive Le Parisien!"
1663,4,4.0,1,2013-11-06,"This is not some gourmet Michelin star restaurant, but in terms of authentic Parisian cafés, it's probably as close as you're going to get in manhattan. Highly recommended if that's what you're going for. Staff was very nice and food was great. Atmosphere is the best thing, which is what you should be coming here for."
1664,4,5.0,1,2013-11-04,Great dinner for a great price! Can't wait to come back again.
1665,4,4.0,1,2013-11-01,"Brunch: Delicious! Egg was perfectly cooked in my eggs Benedict, and the Hollandaise sauce was so tasty! Each of my individual French fries were perfectly crispy. How is that possible? French toast was amazing too. And very friendly people."
1666,4,5.0,1,2013-10-31,"Wonderful service, amazingly convenient location, lively atmosphere and reasonably priced. That being said, the food is the star!  Appetizers, entrees and dessert... all were sublime.  This place is a new fave."
1667,4,3.0,1,2013-10-31,"Soup, escargot and mussels were a 3.5 but the sancerre wine and ambience made up for the so-so food."
1668,4,4.0,1,2013-10-30,"Very cozy, good food at a reasonable price"
1669,4,4.0,1,2013-10-30,"Excellent food. I can't tell you how authentic the food is, since I'm not sure what makes steak tartare and french fries more or less french....suffice, it was good. The meat and salad veer towards the sweet side but not overwhelmingly so...the french fries were...french fries. Cute, small, comfortable place. I think it's reflected well by the reviews."
1670,4,5.0,1,2013-10-29,I met my old boss for lunch yesterday.  The steak frites was excellent -- the pommes frites especially.  Nice selection of wines by the glass as well.  A worthy successor in Murray Hill to the old Bienvenue on 36th between Madison and 5th.
1671,4,2.0,1,2013-10-27,I do not recommend this place. Far too many French bistros to settle here. The mussels Parisienne were very dry and the French fries too salty. The duck dry as well although the potatoes and mushrooms had a nice zing with the spices used. Ordered artichoke salad for entree artichokes lovely seasoned although a tad over cooked. Did not pair well with the dressing and arugula. This place was recommended by a friend since. Was in the Murray hill area. Thank you but no thank you. Too pricey for the quality of food.
1672,4,4.0,1,2013-10-24,"Le Parisien is a quaint bistro reminiscent of a small Paris café.  Start with the escargot and mop up the delicious green garlic sauce with plenty of bread that they bring to the table.  I usually never order salads at restaurants because too many are uninspired and boring, but the endive salad was creative both in taste as well as presentation. Can't go wrong with mussels here-- I have tried the Parisienne and Espagnole and both are delicious and LARGE portions. The frites that come with the mussels are crispy and perfect for dipping in the sauce. The duck confit entrée was good but not great and quite a small portion, especially in comparison to the mussels."
1673,4,4.0,1,2013-10-22,"Le Parisien certainly lives up to its name; it does remind me of the casual Parisian food that I consumed while in Paris. My companion and I had the pate, steak frites, and salmon entrees. The steak was properly cooked to order with American-style doneness (i.e., a medium will not get you a French-style medium cooked steak, which is actually more of a medium-rare here in the states). The pate and salmon were as one would expect. Service is fairly snappy. Prices here are not bad at all considering the area of Manhattan that this establishment is located in. Seating is fairly cramped to the point where it is close to being a fire hazard in the legal sense, haha. Despite the lack of space between tables, we were able to hear each other just fine.   Reservations are an absolute must. I made one the night before for a Friday without a problem, but the restaurant was filled to its seams when we got there."
1674,4,5.0,1,2013-10-21,"I love this place!  It is small and quaint and so authentic.  I spent years living in France and am always looking for places that have that je ne sais quoi (ugh, I know...) and Le Parisien has it.  We went there for dinner on a Friday and got a table by the window before the place filled up (and it fills up quickly!).  Service was great, everyone working there was so friendly and attentive - you can tell they really care about what they are doing and have incredible pride in their food and service.  Even the owner was waiting tables and clearing dishes.   The food is amazing and the menu is really decently priced.  This is the real deal.  I had the steak tartare and my boyfriend had the duck - both were out of this world.  It is a place where you can have a great meal and a few drinks without breaking the bank.  I have recommended this place to everyone I know!"
1675,4,4.0,1,2013-10-21,"Have been here many times and the food is usually wonderful. Artichoke salad was wonderful.  Carpaccio lacked the meat.  it was hard to find under the salad, however what was there was tasty.  Roasted chicken was a tad overdone. Creme Brulee divine."
1676,4,4.0,1,2013-10-17,"Been here twice and absolutely love it! I came here for the mussels and boy, they are no joke! So good! I literally craved their mussels after coming here the first time. I had the Parisinne first time and the Thai second time. While both were excellent, the Thai is by far the much tastier one. It had so much more flavor and the Thai spices really complimented the mussels. I know I know, it's a French restaurant, but trust me on this one, the Thai mussels are better than the Parissinne! The portion is quite big and it is served with a side of french fries...or should I say pomme frites? hahaha. The fries are alright, nothing too special. Atmosphere is great too. It's a cute little restaurant with about 10 tables. Quite cozy with cute French themed posters. I highly recommend this place! By far the best place I've been so far in the City for mussels!"
1677,4,4.0,1,2013-10-16,"Husband and I yelped whatever French was nearby and Le Parisien came up and since it was one if the closer locations, we decided on this place. Great choice! We had no reservation but was seated right away (we got lucky!) the place is tiny. Ordered the duck pate for appetizers and we scarfed it down. Husband is not too fond of pate, but he liked this one. He ordered the bistrot steak frites, EXCELLENT!! We were both thoroughly pleased with his dish. I had the duck confit. It was delicious. But if I could choose, I'd order the steak frites. And for dessert, ordered the creme brûlée. So amazing! Loved everything about this restaurant except the tiny space."
1678,4,5.0,1,2013-10-15,"We really enjoyed our dinner here. Great food, my arugula salad was especially good. We will be back."
1679,4,4.0,1,2013-10-14,"We arrived a few minutes early for our 8PM reservation; a very pleasant lady said there would be a short wait for our table.  We waited outside as it was a pleasant evening and there is no space to wait inside.  The beet salad and the pear salad were amazing and another guest with our party raved about the wild mushroom soup selection they offered that evening.  The salmon and skate were deliciously prepared and perfectly done.  The steak was tender and delicious, the sauce not overpowering. We will be back."
1680,4,4.0,1,2013-10-14,"Stayed in the Murray Hill neighborhood this weekend. My wife and I dined here on Friday night. We showed up a bit after 9:00 pm and were seated by 9:15. Definitely comparable to a Paris bistro based on how close together the tables are! I don't say this as a negative; I think it brings a charm to a place. It definitely invokes memories of our trip to Paris. Somehow Chez Denise at lunchtime was quieter, though. This place was quite loud. I ordered the soup du jour which was cream of wild mushroom. My wife didn't order a starter, but my soup was served with two spoons, without having to ask. Very nice -- and not unnoticed. I thought the soup was very nice, supple and velvety. My wife thought it was too thin. I saw it more as a dish for the working class, staying well shy of thick and cloying, rather than rich with butter and cream -- the kind of soup that puts sweaters on your teeth. These are expensive ingredients, and not always what you find in Parisian bistros. It was perfectly seasoned. For mains, my wife ordered the bistro steak frites (onglet, aka hangar steak), and I ordered steak tartare. I was a bit taken aback when the server asked if I knew what that was, like I was a rube. Maybe I look the part, I don't know. I guess there are folks that have ordered it and freaked out when raw beef showed up. Whatever. Anyway, it was a very good steak tartare. My only complaint would be the egg yolk. It was a very pale yellow, indicating to me the ""good eggs"" weren't used. The steak had that nice briny undertone you want, and was very fresh. It too was perfectly seasoned. And I think the portion was just right. My wife's dish was yet again, perfectly executed Paris bistro. We both had frites. I felt like they might have been slightly overcooked, but the flavor was just awesome. It's not too often I experience the sweetness that potatoes can exhibit. The flavor on these was just great. While I wish the wine list was a bit more broad, it offered some great selections, in particular some nice options from the Rhône. We went with the Côtes du Rhône, which was everything I expected. There was a lovely looking Châteauneuf-du-Pape on the menu I would have loved to try, but it was a bit rich for my budget that evening. Overall we had a great experience. Would definitely recommend."
1681,4,4.0,1,2013-10-09,"Legit French fare for a non-French price. Bona fide waiter, tasty but characteristically small portions. The duck confit was perfectly done. Delicious latte to cap off the night. I highly highly recommend!"
1682,4,2.0,1,2013-10-07,Below average food and ambiance.
1683,4,2.0,1,2013-10-06,"The waiter was rushing us in and did not even care if we made a reservation or not. He seemed very uninterested in serving us when we decided not to drink. Mussels Marinieres was okay. A bit too salty, so I tried to eat with bread (a lot of bread). The french fries were super hard and juiced with smelly oil."
1684,4,5.0,1,2013-10-05,"We had a lovely meal in a very relaxed and comfortable environment.   The food was delicious, the service friendly and low key.  All in all, I felt as though I was in Paris.  I loved it, and look forward to going again.  Thanks, Emil,for the recommendation!"
1685,4,4.0,1,2013-09-30,"Intimate, romantic, authentic, small tables, brusque service ... felt like I was in Paris."
1686,4,5.0,1,2013-09-29,"really delicious-- we ordered escargot and the mussels espangole to start. heavenly. for our main courses my boyfriend ordered the duck confit and i got the poached salmon. loved every bite!! they don't make changes to the order, but when i mentioned my gluten sensitivity the server knew what i could eat and what i couldn't. they also serve wine in carafes if you aren't up for a full bottle of wine. highly recommend.... but you definitely need a reservation-- we did it online the day before and our two reasonable choices were 6 and 830... took the 6 and the restaurant was already packed."
1687,4,4.0,1,2013-09-26,"Thanks Yelp- I was meeting a dear old high school friend, and she was coming into the City via train, and asked if we could meet near Grand Central.  I did a quick search on places near Grand Central, and came up with Le Parisien.   The short version of this place is don't judge a book by its cover- the restaurant is tiny, and frankly, it's a bit shabby (as is the bathroom, which is all of three steps from the dining room), and the service is authentically brusque (take the following exchange: ""I'll have coffee.""  Delivered to the table: iced coffee.  Dining companion ""I actually wanted hot coffee."" Waiter: Shrug.  ""We don't HAVE coffee.""  Dining companion: ""You're kidding!"" Waiter: ""Kidding! Hmph. Espresso only!"")   But the reasonably priced and very tasty food -- and the reasonably priced wine list -- here is what draws the crowds (do yourself a favor- make a reservation!).  The perfectly juicy pan roasted chicken ($19) is served with wild mushrooms, and a heavenly potato puree.  And though I never order pasta at French restaurants, I was craving some serious carbs, so I had the pappardelle with cherry tomatoes, basil, and asiago - this tasted like summer, pure and simple, but with a serious kick of crushed red pepper. It's nice to know that if you have a friend coming in from Grand Central, the only option isn't Chipotle."
1688,4,1.0,1,2013-09-25,"The 14.95 fixe priced brunch brought me and my friends in Saturday morning. The meal started off great with a round of mimosas and great conversation. I unfortunately ordered the Croque Monsieur and was excited for it. But when I got my food, it was cold, the cheese was congealed and tasted like rubber. The ham tasted like package deli meat... The kind with the slime and the ""brioche"" was the ends of a bread loaf. I felt like puking after two bites. It was literally inedible and super dissappointing. Ugh never again!"
1689,4,4.0,1,2013-09-22,"Went for dinner at 7:30 on a Saturday night, with a reservation. Tips: I would definitely go with a reservation--seating is very limited, and the space is small, so without a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, getting a seat would take a while. Food: Ordered the steak tartare--friends ordered the french onion soup, endive salad, steak frites. The steak tartare was very yummy (although I've never had any before, so I have nothing to which I can compare it). A little too garlic-y, but nonetheless quite tasty for a patty of ground raw meat. It was served with fries, but it was annoying that the fries they gave me were clearly the end bits (barely 1 inch long fries) while my friends got the long, normal fries.... Steak frites were also very good, if a little too salty. Wine selection is fair as well, with good prices ($29 for a bottle of sauvignon blanc, $8 for the glass). We also tried the creme brulee and it was a great choice--I don't usually like creme brulee, but it wasn't too sweet, and the textures were indicative of a well-made brulee. Service: The two French owners (I presumed) are friendly and prompt with their service and communication. Very accommodating. However, the server who gave us our food was too brusque, a little unfriendly, and didn't have very good service manners (i.e. just grabbing things from in front of us in a brusque manner/shoving things aside kind of carelessly). Will definitely come back again, and it's definitely a good place for a date."
1690,4,4.0,1,2013-09-20,"Tasty, freshly prepared French dishes at a good price.  Place is a little on the smaller side, but not bad."
1691,4,4.0,1,2013-09-19,"I'm really fond of this place.  It does have a more Parisian feel than a lot of other bistros in the city.  It's small and gets pretty loud--a better place for friends than an intimate date.  Steak frites are solid, wine was good, and I left very happy.  I'll definitely be back."
1692,4,5.0,1,2013-09-18,Great find in Murray Hill. The food was  delicious and very reasonably priced for the area. Service was warm and attentive. Very convivial despite the small room.
1693,4,4.0,1,2013-09-13,"French onion soup, one of the best I've had. Not too salty yet flavorful. The evenly baked cheese on top does not overwhelm the onion soup at all. The beef tartar was very refreshing, didn't think I would finish it but I devoured it in less than 5 minutes. Loved it. Got the mussels as well, they were really fresh and meaty not dry. However the tomato base I choose for it was really light, wish I went with the garlic one instead Waiters were nice, kept asking if we needed anything and made sure our water is always filled. I would definitely go back to try other dishes :)"
1694,4,5.0,1,2013-09-10,"Excellent all around -- great food, truly outstanding service, and amazingly reasonable prices.  We're going back ..."
1695,4,5.0,1,2013-09-09,"Took a girl here for brunch, place was absolutely delicious. The eggs Benedict gave my mouth the best food orgasm it ever had. Real talk stop reading this and go eat here."
1696,4,5.0,1,2013-09-09,Gem... nothing fancy just fantastic food.  Wish the beer/wine options were a little more extensive.  All in all just a true French Bistro experience!
1697,4,4.0,1,2013-09-01,Went there for the brunch on a week-end. This is definitely a French place as everybody is French out there. Nice decor although not fancy. Food and service were good. Will go back.
1698,4,4.0,1,2013-08-31,Great brunch. Loved the atmosphere and our eggs florentine were cooked perfectly. Service was fast and my water glass was never left empty. The place is on the smaller side so plan accordingly if you have a big party!
1699,4,4.0,1,2013-08-25,The French toast is very fluffy! Apple compote and banana are fresh! Good meal!
1700,4,4.0,1,2013-08-23,pleasant surprise
1701,4,4.0,1,2013-08-21,"I came here with my friend for a belated birthday celebration (for me).  This is another hole in the wall spot but adorable nonetheless.  Not too fancy, not too dark, but it's just right.  The staff was extremely courteous and helpful;  We were assisted with wine selection, meal of the day, as well as dessert.  Our waiter saw that she gave me a birthday card and served my dessert with a candle! I thought that was super cool and thoughtful. Best for couples, dates, or besties to relax, chill, and eat pretty authentic french food. Would I go back, most definitely."
1702,4,4.0,1,2013-08-19,"Small and quiet. Great service, and a small but unique menu with both French classics and unique dishes. Great wine selection with a wait staff that is more than willing to help you choose the perfect bottle. Nice portion size."
1703,4,4.0,1,2013-08-12,"Stopped in here randomly for brunch and really enjoyed it. My boyfriend loved his eggs benedict, I was crazy about the frittata. Free sangria didn't hurt!"
1704,4,4.0,1,2013-08-10,"A friend from Cali and I had brunch here this afternoon. She had a spinach omlette and specified she only wanted egg whites.  I had a Croque Monsiuer, which came with a salad.  The food was delivered fast, correct and delicious.  The service was prompt and our waters were refilled promptly.  For brunch, $13.95 gets you a tasty, satisfying entrée and a mimosa, san gria, coffee or OJ.  I opted for the fruity wine and I was very pleased.  I will definitely be back."
1705,4,4.0,1,2013-08-09,get the steak!! delish
1706,4,4.0,1,2013-08-07,"Good, unpretentious food. I had dinner there, late one Saturday, with my wife. The food was excellent, the wine was good. My wife had the special that night, striped bass, with ratatouille and olive tapenade. She loved it. I had a steak frites, and we shared a creme brulee. Service was quick and attentive, ambiance was not too noisy. We enjoyed ourselves. We will definitely return."
1707,4,4.0,1,2013-08-05,"Tiny place which plays into its 'boutique' feel which wasn't bad.  Nothing on the menu honestly looked authentic French aside from the traditional escargo but the service was a bid spacey with no urgency of accelerating the dining experience; so appropriate if you're looking for the 'authentic' french experience.  I will say however the Filet Mignon Carpaccio was quite elegant and tasty.  The Duck confit was equally presented and delightful.  I also recommend the dessert menus in which you can't seem to go wrong.  All in all, pretty good experience with cheap wine and affordable cuisine.  So more like 3 1/2 stars."
1708,4,4.0,1,2013-08-04,"Delicious, authentic and very cute. Ate brunch there and definitely want to go back for dinner."
1709,4,4.0,1,2013-08-02,"Great french dinner! From the outside, I was expecting it to be a little fancier than it was inside.  Decor was not as charming as I expected, but then the food and service began and all worries of pretentiousness were thrown out the window. Just finished up a delicious dinner there with the gf.  They squeezed us in (squoze us in?) for a friday dinner at 7pm.  Staff very courteous to us and all patrons - even as they had to turn away most walk-ins.  My spinach and goat cheese salad was really delicious, with just the right amount of dressing.  Her french onion soup was great, with just the right amount of salty and sweet - though it needed a little fresh pepper. My skate was excellent, her half chicken was good.  She replaced the mashed potatos with the frites - excellent choice.  The dessert - get the creme brulee - as others have said, it was outstanding. A bit pricey when the final bill came, but was a great meal overall.  Will definitely return, and would like to try brunch some time."
1710,4,4.0,1,2013-08-02,"Made an early - 6:30 is early by NY standards - reservation here for myself and my parents. It was the perfect atmosphere for us to catch up and eat well. The hostess/waitress/owner? Seated us immediately and was lovely despite  the demands of running the entire front of house. My parents go to France often, the atmosphere and in my father's words this place 'truly transports you to France and the only difference is there is a working air con'.  To start we had  escargot, country pâté, and tomato soup/goat cheese special. For mains the chicken, mussels, and calves liver. I would say the chicken was the star, crispy skin and full flavored. Escargot was delicious and calves liver was cooked perfect, deliciously slightly pink on the inside. The mussels fell a little short, this did not stop me from devouring any my mother didn't find in the creamy white wine broth. Profiteroles and Island capped the night with a ruby port. I love a place that serves ruby though this one was really mild. Will dream of the profiteroles and pass on the Island next time."
1711,4,4.0,1,2013-07-31,"This is a great find in the Murray Hill neighborhood. The place is small but cozy. I ordered the saffron and mustard cream mussels and was very satisfied by the taste. Lots of food for a great price. Service was adequate. Overall, no major complaints."
1712,4,5.0,1,2013-07-29,"Family lunch... french style!!  Excellent food, wonderful service. and great atmosphere! A little small but just adds to it!"
1713,4,5.0,1,2013-07-22,This is the real deal.  If you are looking for true French food Le Parisien is the place to go.   My wife had the duck confit and said it tasted just like it is prepared in France.  She is a French teacher and travels to France often.   I had the bistro steak and it was great.  It was more like chateaubriand then anything else!
1714,4,4.0,1,2013-07-22,"I found Le Parisien as I was searching online for affordable brunch in NYC. I'm a visual learner, so the pics of the food looked amazing. We decided to give it a go. When we arrived we were greeted immediately and seated. I had the salmon benedict and it was really really good. The eggs were poached perfectly. I will definitely go back and try their dinner menu."
1715,4,3.0,1,2013-07-21,"We would rate Le Parisien a 3.5 if we could. Our party of four liked the casual setting and friendly staff. The steak frites was fantastic, poached salmon was good. Spinach salad was very good, but could have done with more goat cheese on it. Mussels did the job, frites were best. One person loved the roast squash soup with apple, though I thought it was too sweet. Would go again for an easy neighborhood dinner."
1716,4,4.0,1,2013-07-20,"great place and great food....a little small though, but overall it is a nice little place..."
1717,4,4.0,1,2013-07-16,"Adorable little French bistro in Murray Hill. Came here for Bastille Day with two friends an had a delicious dinner. We shared the Marseilles mussels, steak tartar, and duck confit, along with a great bottle of white wine. The restaurant is a little in the small side (~10-15 tables) so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time!"
1718,4,4.0,1,2013-07-16,I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere was quaint and they had a nice selection of wine and food to choose from. I had the salmon which was amazing and some pomme frittes. We also enjoyed the wine list and the staff was very helpful in making selections.  This was a good experience all around. Thanks for reading and enjoy.
1719,4,4.0,1,2013-07-13,"This is a great brunch restaurant. Their weekend menu has a prix fix deal that includes a mimosa, a coffee, or Bellini with your meal. I ordered the croque monsieur. It was very tasty and I enjoyed it a lot. It also came with a salad on the side. The bread was awesome, the service was great, and the mimosa was pretty legit. It can get a little crowded during lunch so go around 12:30 or earlier if you want to be seated quickly. Also, the place can get a little loud. Small place. Lots of people trying to have a conversation. So if one table starts getting loud, everyone just ends up screaming at their friends while they talk. Therefore, if you eat here. Keep your voice down for the rest of us. Don't scream at your friends. Love them, softly... Thank you!"
1720,4,4.0,1,2013-07-11,The food here was good as well as the service. I really enjoyed eating here and look forward to coming here with some other friends. The waiter was also very attentive and friendly which i appreciate.
1721,4,3.0,1,2013-07-10,"This place can be easily missed because it's a very unassuming, and also off of a main avenue. The inside is small so make reservations when you can. I needed a last minute place for dinner and they luckily had space. I had the duck confit - it was very well made, not overly oily, as I've had in some places, and well-seasoned. I didn't have a dessert but my friends had profiteroles, which they loved. The service was great and the staff didn't rush you out like many other restaurants in the city."
1722,4,4.0,1,2013-07-07,"I haven't been to France in almost 8 years (a little piece of me just died just having said that), but Le Parisien came pretty close to bringing me back without the use of teleporting. Don't know why but I was expecting more of a romantic high end atmosphere... and I'm glad that it wasn't. The mood was casual yet intimate and had a certain je ne sais quoi with its vintage posters, café furniture and candles. It reminded me of all those little bistros I would pop into for a meal while running around gay Paris (pronounced ""PAH-ree"" of course). The owners are French so when it comes to generating that French bistro feel, they know what they're doing. One look at the menu and I was hooked. Steak? Duck? Mussels? Tartare? Check, check and double check. Heck, they even have escargot. I don't eat snails though; I had too many of them as pets as a child. Still, they got 'em. Appetizers -Duck Prosciutto with Melon and Fennel Salad: To start, I had this special. Although the duck was tasty and the melon ripe and juicy, I just wish there had been more of le quack. Oh well. -French Onion Soup: My friend ordered this for his appetizer. I was able to steal a hearty spoonful of the broth/cheese/bread combo and thought it was superb. Just how I remembered it. Entrees -Duck Confit with Crispy Potatoes, Mushrooms and Frisée Salad: The potatoes weren't particularly crispy but the duck skin sure was! Crispy on the outside and juice dark meat on the inside on top of a fresh bed of frisée and thinly sliced mushrooms. My only qualm was that portion was on the small side as well. I guess they guard their duck very closely here. -Steak Tartare with Salad and French Fries: Definitely my favorite of the night and the LARGEST of all the entrees. They present you with a giant slab of perfectly seasoned raw beef with a raw egg yolk on top in it's shell alongside a bed of fresh greens. Oh and they give you a hearty serving of delicious, crispy fries. If you love steak tartare this entree is your best bet! It satisfies all of your cravings. Ok my cravings. After all of this food, I had to forgo the dessert menu even though the items looked delicious. Other diners around me kept ordering the crème brûlée which I kept hearing was fantastic. Service throughout by our lovely French waiters was attentive but not overly so. I also loved the selection of wines by the glass which were posted on the giant chalk board near the front. Love that they have wines from Cote du Rhone. La Parisien has definitely become my go to French restaurant that won't cost me my first born. They have a $13.95 brunch special that I really want to check out but let's be honest, unless they decide to serve steak tartar at that time, I'm coming back for dinner first."
1723,4,4.0,1,2013-06-26,"This is my new favorite. Its a cheap competitor to Balthazar with a limited menu. Food quality is as good and flavors are authentic french brassiere. Calves livers, steak, moules, pomme frit were all great. Escargot were overcooked and i suspect they are canned, but that's ok i'm not paying 20 bucks. Three ppl with a bottle of wine $150. Service is typical take it or leave it French"
1724,4,3.0,1,2013-06-25,"I am not a huge fan of American brunch...and this place does not meet the standards of the best brunch places I have been to in NYC...So, in terms of food, this place is average. However, I would like to say it is a very quaint place, the setting is a bit traditional. The manager (maybe?) appears to be French. The service is definitely nice, they are very attentive -- I did not try any sangria myself, but my dining buddy definitely enjoyed it. For $13.95 including brunch + sangria/mimosa/coffee, it's not a bad deal in NYC."
1725,4,5.0,1,2013-06-24,Really great gem of a place.  I felt like I was back in Paris while I was eating there.  I'd definitely go back again!
1726,4,5.0,1,2013-06-19,"Overall, it's an excellent, casual, French, neighborhood bistro. The food is tasty and recipes are authentic. The service, from my numerous experiences there, has always been consistent and solid. The owner and the staff are very friendly, but not too intrusive. The decor I find very cozy and alludes to a old Parisian atmosphere. I would recommend this place any time of the week. However, beware they can be very busy for brunch or dinner on weekend so you might want to plan ahead! Among my go-to dishes are the steak-frites, endive salad, and the goat cheese salad. Although I don't eat them, I heard the mussels were great!"
1727,4,3.0,1,2013-06-18,"After suffering a withdrawal from the brasserie-life of Paris, my wife and I were delighted to discover this little spot. Service was prompt, decor was nice (a little over the top) and most importantly, the food was exactly what I was looking for. Escargot - 6 on a classic serving tray. Quite large. Very tasty & Mussles (moules marinières) is the quintessential French holiday dish. Prices seem reasonable, though I really dislike this neighborhood. Had the location been in LES (or downtown in general), I'd bump it up to 4 stars."
1728,4,4.0,1,2013-06-17,"Very neat and authentic little french place owned by a french couple. It made me feel as if I am in Paris. Would recommend the escargot, the mussels, daily fishes, and also the duck...none of them are the best in the city, but all are above average at very resonable prices. Also has a very friendly wine list that offers 10-15 different selections, not great, but pairs fine with its family setting and atmosphere. Their desserts were great too, I have had the apple tart and the cream brulee thus far and would return and order them again and again!"
1729,4,1.0,1,2013-06-17,Can i have a little skate with my ammonia? Skate was so ammoniated the fumes shot through my nose and singed my brain. Saw someone else send back escargots. Whhyyyy is this place so popular? +1 star for prompt service and the authentic ambience. But ammoniated skate is unforgivable.
1730,4,4.0,1,2013-06-08,"We  read some good reviews and made a reservation for a half hour later. Our table was ready upon arrival. This is a charming little restaurant in the Murray Hill neighborhood. We ordered a variety of foods, pea and mint soup was very fresh, warm lentil salad was delicious with a mild flavorful dressing and very fresh watercress. I had a grilled baby artichoke arugula salad with a few roasted to tomatoes. The vinegarette was so sublime,just perfectly balanced. All the greens were very fresh. The steak and frittes were good and one of the specials was great: duck breast with roasted white peaches. We were very pleased with everything ."
1731,4,5.0,1,2013-06-04,Came here for dinner last week. The atmosphere was cozy and charming. And the food was FANTASTIC. I ordered the pappardelle pasta and my friend ordered the pork. Both were excellent. Will definitely be returning.
1732,4,3.0,1,2013-05-29,Wanted to like it.  The steak frites were not terribly good. It was cooked right but onion glaze was a tad strange and meat a was a little sinewy.  The fries were over cooked just a bit. Service was unattentive. No baguettes not any cheese to be found. Parisien? I'm afraid not...
1733,4,5.0,1,2013-05-28,"Went there with a couple of girlfriends for brunch and then again with a friend for dinner.  They don't take reservations for brunch but there was no wait since we arrived shortly after they opened. Everything was delicious. For brunch:  We had the poached eggs with salmon, ham and gruyère sandwich, and eggs florentine with spinach. Each dish comes with a drink (we had mimosas and sangria) for $13.95. For dinner:  We shared the filet mignon carpaccio to start.  Then we ordered the Marinieres mussels - the serving size was decent and the broth was delicious, and the duck confit which was excellently done with a nice crispy skin.  For dessert we shared the upside down apple pie with ice cream which.. didn't amaze me. Note:  The tables are extremely close together so if it's crowded don't expect to have a private conversation."
1734,4,4.0,1,2013-05-27,"My overall experience here was very  enjoyable. With a reservation at 7pm on a Friday night, I was happily seated 10 mins earlier while waiting for my friends to arrive. The wine here is really inexpensive. A not-so-fancy bottle of wine starts at $35, which is almost unheard of in the area. I would highly recommend the mussels. Great portion to share and is accompanied by a side of fries. All entrees we had were pleasant. The steak frites and duck confit were very well executed. The desserts were not as impressive."
1735,4,4.0,1,2013-05-24,"Have actually gone twice.  The first time for dinner and then for brunch.  Both times a great experience.  Wife had the liver, that was very good, I had the steak and frits, which despite being marinated which I normally dont like, was very good.  Service was excellent.  Best point, you can order a 1/2 litre of wine, like in Europe or Canada. The Brunch was also very good!"
1736,4,4.0,1,2013-05-23,"being from Canada and noticing how inexpensive the wine was it was a no brainer ordering up a nice Grand Cru bottle at $49. I really enjoyed the food here: buttery escargot, tender juicy steak and the roasted artichoke shrimp. every dish was very flavorful and prepared flawlessly. the service was equally exceptional. Overall great value resto in nyc be sure to book reservations as seating is limited in this paris style décor resto."
1737,4,4.0,1,2013-05-22,Delicious brunch. I've been here four times for brunch. It is consistently great. Highlights include the goat cheese frittata and the French toast. Minus one star for the price increase and the cramped quarters.
1738,4,4.0,1,2013-05-22,"Lovely place, perfect for a casual, well-prepared meal.  Small, intimate, maybe a little noisy but for just two people not a problem.  Excellent service, very friendly and accommodating, we felt right at home.  Appetizers (beef carpaccio and duck pate) were terrific, first rate; mussels and steak frites main courses were good to very good, especially the frites, fabulous.  Apple tarte tatin with vanilla ice cream a satisfying dessert, the espresso was full and rich, no bitterness.  Wine list modest, but well priced and no problem finding something very potable for our meal.  The price was very fair.  If we lived in NYC, it would be the perfect place to go, especially impromptu during the week, for a casual, relaxed dinner.  We are out of towners, but will definitely go again on our next New York trip.  Richard K. Scher"
1739,4,4.0,1,2013-05-16,"One of the few French restaurants close to me. Small and tidy, serves great french cuisine. Also, for the price, the lunch is a great value."
1740,4,1.0,1,2013-05-15,"Kitchen was closed at 10:15, so o early."
1741,4,5.0,1,2013-05-15,"Paris in NYC! Really reminded me of a Parisian restaurant - cozy space, open windows, cute decor, I can go on. We were seated immediately despite not having reservations. I had the steak & fries and my company ordered the salmon. Both dishes were EXCELLENT and the portions were just right."
1742,4,3.0,1,2013-05-13,"Cute little cafe with a great $13.95 brunch option that comes with one drink.  This price is on the menu, so not sure why this is also their yelp check-in offer--no need for that! Food came out pretty quickly... the eggs benedict is better than the garden omelet which was bland.  Fries are good and salad is fresh."
1743,4,5.0,1,2013-05-13,Le Parisien is a small and cozy French bistro.  Reminds me of France! I ordered the Pouched Eggs with Salmon Gravlax on English Muffins with Hollandaise Sauce with a glass of Sangria for $15.  The Grilled Steak Sandwich on Ciabatta and the Mussels with Garlic and White Wine Sauce were yummy.  Great brunch spot and I will definitely be coming back.
1744,4,4.0,1,2013-05-05,"We had a very good meal at Le Perisien. There were three of us and all of our food was good. My husband said his tomato soup was some of the best he's ever had. The atmosphere is simple, but nice. The service was excellent. Fair prices, especially for the city. Would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a reliably good meal at a reasonable price."
1745,4,4.0,1,2013-04-23,"Cute little spot for brunch, felt tiny with lots French flair (...literally there's a ton of French iconography adorning the walls). Reasonable brunch deal for $14 that comes with one drink, coffee or cocktail or juice. I had to order a croque monsieur which was outstanding but sadly didn't come with fries (fries are only served with the egg meals).  I paid extra to get coffee and fries; the fries were a little disappointing. The service was good and the croque monsieur will ensure my return."
1746,4,3.0,1,2013-04-16,"Having had dined here twice before, I realized the place is either a hit or miss - the food was completely different the first and second time around. First, the atmosphere is definitely very genuine and akin to a bistro in Paris. Slow service where you really gotta sip on some wine and chat. For the first visit I had the Espagnole, chorizo mussels which were delicious..i literally wanted to slurp the soup! My friend had the French onion soup and pork tenderloin which I was able to taste and enjoyed both very much. Overall, that was a hit experience. However the second time my party and I shared the Thai mussels as an appetizer portion. Though it was still flavorful, the Espagnole was definitely better. I decided to go a bit more adventurous and had their special for the night - monkfish with a potato purée, scallions, mushrooms. That was a mistake! It could've been 5 bites and for $25?! My friend's steak frites, the most highlighted menu item, was really good. Juicy, savory, appetizing but then again how can you go wrong with steak frites! If I had to come back again this is the only thing I feel really worth getting. After trying La Sirene, I couldn't help being biased since they have many more creative items. I would recommend La Sirene more for the food."
1747,4,5.0,1,2013-04-16,"Excellent, real bistro-style French restaurant, with steak-frites as good as what you could get in Paris. Fantastic desserts (especially the profiteroles). Good atmosphere, good wine choice and great service. Wish I lived a LOT closer to this place. If I'm in New York again, I'll definitely be back."
1748,4,4.0,1,2013-04-16,"Came here with a couple of friends for some delicious french food.   Great selection of wine. Mussels --awesome flavor, huge bowl (great for sharing) Steak fritz --the winner of the table!!! yum yum yum, perfectly cooked, huge slab of fries. Envy of the table. Fresh fish -some time of cod, good flavor, medium portion *Make reservations* or you will be waiting a bit, very small inside (~15 tables)"
1749,4,4.0,1,2013-04-11,"This is a cute little restaurant we found. Very small but the food was fantastic. I had the special for the day which was the skate fish, which was flavored nicely with the mushroom. Mussels marineres were good with the white wine and garlic broth even though it was a bit over cooked, the mussels came to be quite small. Overall I would recommend this place we've tried a couple other appetizers that was delicious as well. Service was good. Price was very reasonable for a French restaurant."
1750,4,3.0,1,2013-04-08,"Nothing special, it might be because I have eaten in Paris or maybe because it was bland and flavorless but I am totally not impressed nor would I need to go back. The atmosphere is nice... you do feel like you in Paris but the food doesn't match the atmosphere. We had escargot, potato and garlic soup, the mussels and the duck confit and none of those dishes were impressive. They weren't bad but they weren't good either. just ok."
1751,4,4.0,1,2013-04-07,"I went here for my small birthday brunch with a group of 5 women. Previously, on the phone, I was told the space is small and not conducive for big groups but was advised that I should arrive later for a better chance of getting a table (since they don't take reservations). I arrived at 1PM and as soon as my full party arrived they accommodated 5 of us in a very packed bistro! Fantastic and reliable dishes across the board including highlights like a croque monsieur with ham and poached eggs with lox & hollandaise sauce including a large variety of healthier options. I even dropped my phone behind the tall couches and the waitress was kind enough to try her luck and inch her way in and get it out of the crevice. Wonderful service and lovely people. I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the dirty and cramped bathroom and lack of attention to our water glasses."
1752,4,5.0,1,2013-04-04,"The food here is great, been eating here every time I come to NYC. This is an example of what makes a good restaurant - excellent food, reasonable pricing (have not raised prices in 3 years). The decor is simple, yet unusual, makes you feel like you are dining in a small bistro in Paris :-)"
1753,4,5.0,1,2013-04-01,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place for lunch while we were visiting the city and it was so good we came back for the Sunday brunch!  For lunch we split an onion soup and then the portobello sandwich for me and a chicken sandwich for him.  Both were amazing- all of the ingredients were fresh, flavorful, and well presented on the sandwich (I hate when you get served a sandwich that is humanely impossible to eat as a sandwich).  My boyfriend said it might be his favorite sandwich he's ever eaten. We came back for the Sunday brunch and it was just as amazing as we expected it to be!  I loved that my salmon gravlox came with both greens and fries.  The restaurant itself is small but charmingly decorated with French posters and a very comfortable environment.  Staff is great.  We were so happy to have found this place and will definitely return when we are back!"
1754,4,4.0,1,2013-04-01,"This is such a nice little find, in the heart of midtown east.  I would never have though to go out to this area for food, but we happened to be in the area.  I poked my eyes through the window and saw that it was full, and there was one table left.  Surely it was a sign - and at $13.95 for brunch with a drink, you can't beat the price. Two of us had the Eggs with Salmon Gravlax and one a mushroom omelette with asiago cheese.  The Eggs with Salmon was beautiful when it arrived.  The eggs were slightly running but cooked enough so it's not like I'm eating a raw egg.  The frites were thin and crispy.  It came with Ketchup already in a little steel cup.  It annoys me, when they know you will ask for ketchup and they still don't take any preventative measures to place it on your plate or keep a bottle on the table. The Bellini and Sangria were good.  Of course, if you order your drink on the side, you get a much larger glass, but it was enough to satisfy my thirst. A tight little space once you get inside, not much room for maneuvering around.  A couple sat next to us towards the end of our meal and the girl was very annoyed at how small the space is.  For those that have never been to France, many bistros in Paris are actually very small and you will be very comfortable with your neighbors practically at your elbows."
1755,4,4.0,1,2013-03-29,"Good bistro fare in a cozy, friendly atmosphere on the left bank of Murray Hill. Bon appetit!"
1756,4,4.0,1,2013-03-29,"Came here about a week ago for an early-ish (6:30) dinner on a Thursday. The space is small and cozy, but the place wasn't crowded enough for my date and I to not feel squished. And there were candles on the table. Lovely. They had a great wine selection, and the service was quick (without being over-bearing) and friendly. The bread and butter they brought us while we waited for the food was nice - super crunchy and ""French"" like. We shared the addictive escargot (my first time trying them - seriously, don't be afraid: just go for it). They were served in a heavenly pesto-like sauce that we soaked up with bread after the escargot were gone. For entrees, I got a white fish, which was good, but his dish rocked the whole meal: bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. I was able to try a bite, and had serious food envy. The crispy bacon contrasted the melt-in-your-mouth tenderloin perfectly. I wanted to trade entrees, it was so good. We split the creme brulee for dessert. It tasted like marshmallows, which I enjoyed. An overall great experience."
1757,4,5.0,1,2013-03-26,"This is the best french place I've ever been to; impressed by their food.  Most of the French restaurants are very salty but this place is just right.  The atmosphere is cozy, intimate and friendly.  The interior design is like a French apartment...  It makes you feel like you are eating at a friend's house."
1758,4,4.0,1,2013-03-25,"We stopped by Le Parisien for Sunday dinner and had an amazing experience. My brother, who was dining with me, said he had never felt more ""transported"" in a restaurant. It did feel like Paris. The food was exceptional. We got the country pate to start which was rich and subtle and delicious. Then I had the skate wing with orange sauce and my brother had the steak tartare with fries. My fish was well cooked and refreshing. His beef was a tremendous portion of really good tartare and the fries were amazing. It was a great deal--the whole meal was about 45 dollars before tip. Definitely check this place out!"
1759,4,4.0,1,2013-03-25,"A neighborhood French spot that takes you out of the neighborhood. My little sister took me here for my birthday dinner. We had reservations for the tiny (maybe 15 table) spot, but I got the impression that the people sitting at the other tables were regulars. The space itself has been made to look like a small Left Bank bistro complete with fading French posters and newspapers about World Cup victories and stuff. The service isn't too stiff and it isn't too loose. Our waitress had no idea what the specials were and she wasn't afraid to say so, but we never felt neglected or forgotten while we ate. The salmon entre was quite good and the pino grigio we had with it was also enjoyable. We would have stayed for more wine but we had other places to be. Most of the other patrons who were there before us were still there after we left and I wouldn't be surprised if they stayed there for hours. In a part of town where the dinner experience can be less than relaxing, Le Parisien is a welcomed change of pace."
1760,4,5.0,1,2013-03-20,"Good quality and cheap unique price. Authentic French. I got awesome eggs, chips and mimosa."
1761,4,4.0,1,2013-03-16,"Had a lovely lunch here. It has an authentic French menu and my favorites were the escargot and dessert - Îles flottantes. The latter is very hard to find and if you ever see it, order it! It's a vanilla crème anglaise with meringue 'island' atop. Perfection! The only downside is the place is quite small and cramped... but it's not uncomfortable and the service was very good."
1762,4,4.0,1,2013-03-15,"Purpose of visit: Thursday night dinner with another couple. Our friends suggested we go to this local neighborhood restaurant. It is a cozy place with about 15 tables. Definitely a nice intimate warm casual atmosphere. We ordere a nice bottle of cabernet which was pleasantly priced. Appetizers came out quickly, my classic french onion soup was nice and hot and not too cheesy or overwhelmed with onions. We ordered the mussells with chorizo in red sauce. Excellent hoice. Mussells were nicely steamed and the sauce adde a bit o kick to the dish. Main course was pork mendallions wrapped with bacon. Normally anything wrapped with bacon is a thumbs up for me but unfortunately the pork was a little dry for me. The wife's steak dish was a much better choice. For dessert we had the merengue floating in custard pudding. Excellent. The service was attentive and unobstrusive. The atmopshere had a nice busy vibe but not overly crowded. Perfect place for a relaxing dinner at a reasonable price."
1763,4,5.0,1,2013-03-14,"Unbelievable value for the dollar.  Both for the food and the wine list.  If you are seeking great Steak Frittes for a super price, this is your place.   A terrific neighborhood find!"
1317,4,4.0,1,2013-03-14,"Came here for brunch Saturday noon and were pleased to find no line unlike Penelope's. We ordered the frittata and French toast, both were great! Frittata was fluffy and filling and came with fries. The place is quite cramped and the brown curtain hanging on the inside of the front door (to keep cold air out) was a little bit weird. But since the food was good and we didn't have to wait to be seated at noon, I am quite happy."
1764,4,4.0,1,2013-03-12,"Tasty and great neighborhood French bistro. Been twice and would go back again. I recommend the duck confit, steak and tarte tatin."
1765,4,4.0,1,2013-03-08,Took an early dinner there.  Very accomodating when I asked to re-charge my laptop.  Soup of the day was parsnip and leek which is very authentic French country fare.  Entree was skate served on a tasty mound of spinach and broccoli.  Accompanied by a pleasant Sancerre from the by-the-glass menu.  Nice experience!
1766,4,3.0,1,2013-03-04,"This place is adorable!!! And an amazing deal for brunch! We had a couple things go wrong, but all in all, a nice time. For only $14 bucks, you get a mimosa/sangria or coffee + entree. With everything included, it's still less than $20, which is amazing. Place is SO CUTE. It's French and all the people who work there are French and all the decorations on the walls are French. Love it. It's pretty small and can seem kind of romantic, but I'd say it's the perfect vibe for brunch. I got the Eggs Florentine and my friend got the Poached Eggs with smoked salmon. Both were very good! Comes with a small salad and french fries and the eggs on English muffins. Definitely enough food! I wouldn't say it's the best poached eggs or brunch meal, but def good enough. Mimosa was also pretty tasty (though small). My friend ordered a cup of coffee and when the guy delivered it he ended up spilling the coffee everywhere, which was kind of a mess. But it ended up being on the house (we didn't even ask) so that was really nice. Coffee also has free refills. Also, halfway through the meal, I realized my water glass had a gross bumpy dirt residue on the outside. I was kind of disgusted. So it wasn't completely perfect! But I'd come back again and definitely give this place another chance. Plus, the staff were so so nice!"
1767,4,3.0,1,2013-02-27,"Let me first say that I'm not a fan of French cuisine.  I'm a bit clueless as to what to order, which explains why I ordered the pasta instead of something more frenchy. The restaurant ambiance is very cozy with a tables along both walls in an open layout.  Not a bad place for a date night, although I did come here earlier in the evening so the place wasn't packed at that time.  Service was very cordial and friendly.  The gentleman who greeted me offered me any open table. So as mentioned, I ordered the pappardelle pasta.  Probably not the best choice at a French restaurant.  It was a bit average - the pasta itself was good, but the sauce was a bit bland.  Portion size was reasonable, but being more of a meat and potatoes person, I was missing the meat.  My dining partner ordered the duck con fit and said it was very good.  I don't eat duck so I can't really comment as to how good it was. Overall, it was a good place for a good meal.  I'm not a fan of French cuisine so I can't say I'll return.  If I was a fan, this may be my regular place because of the kindness of the staff, the non-pretentiousness of the restaurant, and the reasonable prices of the menu items.  If you're a fan, give this place a try."
1768,4,4.0,1,2013-02-24,"Authentic french restaurant, great for brunch, shared the salmon and mushroom omlette and mimosa!!"
1769,4,5.0,1,2013-02-24,"I thought this place was just fabulous! Lovely place but not super posh or pretentious. Very authentically French. This was one of very few places that every single plate I tried was outstanding. My boyfriend and I each got an app, main course and dessert. All parts were so so tasty and enjoyable ( I sampled every plate). We also each got one drink and the bill came out to about $100 including tip. Overall, for the quality of the food, the atmosphere/service, and price, this place is a steal. Can't wait to come back. Simply charming. You wont be disappointed with this great place!"
1770,4,4.0,1,2013-02-21,"After poring over the brunch menu, I decided on the eggs florentine with a mimosa (of course!) and both were quite tasty. Yum yum spinach! This was my first time having  eggs florentine and I am definitely going to get it again. Also, the fries are addicting so if you know you won't be able to finish, bring someone who you know will help you eat them! Also, I'm not sure if it was a glitch in the system, but last time I came, my credit card got charged for $30 instead of the $16 that was on my receipt. I brought up the issue with Chase who refunded me the difference so it wasn't a big deal. However, it might be good to just keep that in mind."
1771,4,1.0,1,2013-02-21,"Scam alert! Be careful and check your credit card statement if you go here! These guys charged me a $90 tip on a ~$15 bill, thankfully I noticed it on my statement and Amex will take care of it."
1772,4,5.0,1,2013-02-16,"Have been here for brunch and dinner and had a great time both times. The food is great, and the brunch prix fix is a great deal. Good service as well. One of the best spots in the neighborhood. Great for date night."
1773,4,4.0,1,2013-02-13,"It was a nice experience.  I don't have a ton to say either way.  A bit cramped.  Service was great though and the food was lovely.  My girlfriend was very happy - which is always a plus.  Wine, food, really pleasant service.  Good stuff. Sorry - don't have a ton more to say.  Prolly why it isn't a 5"
1774,4,4.0,1,2013-02-11,"It's really cozy, but that gives it charm.  The food was tasty and the waiters were friendly. I would go back."
1775,4,5.0,1,2013-02-10,"This place is as good as it gets. It's a hidden gem in Murray Hill of all places.  I'm almost afraid to write about it, as it's been my secret go-to place.   It's honest real French bistro food prepared by a French chef, served by French ex-pats.  It ain't fancy, and it ain't trying to be trendy. It's perfect.  It's small and it's crowded. The food is always skillfully and deliciously prepared.  Everything seasoned just right. No matter what I have ordered, it's been great. Start with their roasted artichoke salad.  OMG!!! It's a must.  Entrees offer their known-for mussel preparations served with a side of crispy frites.   The real-deal duck confit is served with crispy potatoes and wild mushrooms over a frisee salad..  You'll feel as if you're sitting in a bistro in the Marais.  The roast chicken with pomme puree, or the sautéed cafe's liver topped with caramelized onions are perfect for a cold winter's night.  Oh my.  The pan-roasted skate is to die for.  Or try one of the best steak frites in the city.  It's served with their take on a red wine thyme sauce with glazed shallots.  And of course those can't-stop-eating frites.  The specials are always fantastic.  Last week I had the coq au vin.  It was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful.  Seriously I've never been disappointed. Desserts are traditional too.  Try the profiteroles or the tarte tartan.  Yum. Order a bottle of the Cote de Rhone to go with.  Be happy."
1776,4,4.0,1,2013-02-09,"This place is very small and the decor seems depressing for a place that otherwise seems so French. The man waiting on us and seating us was great, he was very helpful. A lot of the patrons that came in were speaking French. Let's start with the bad. The coffee. Very bad. It was bitter and watered down. I accidentally put way too much creamer in it, but even the excess couldn't give it any flavor. Now the good. The food was decent. Everyone seemed to require salt or pepper or some other spice or condiment to get the food to a truly taste place, but all the ingredients were there."
1777,4,4.0,1,2013-02-06,Wonderful meal at a good price point for NYC! We loved the Grilled Artichoke salad and the Thai Pei Mussels.  Atmosphere reminds me of small cafes in Paris.... :D
1778,4,2.0,1,2013-02-02,"Average for brunch. Prix fixe is reasonable for NYC standards BUT there is nothing remarkable about the food. Decor and wait staff aside, it's not French by any stretch of the imagination. My food was bland and shapeless--and who serves French fries at brunch? Hash browns would be better. Not to mention my ""wild mushroom"" omelette was placed on top of the side salad, wilting all the lettuce and destroying its flavor. (Come to think of it, neither the mushrooms nor supposed cheese could be tasted.) Your average diner will give you a tastier breakfast."
1779,4,5.0,1,2013-02-02,"Other reviews are correct this is indeed a little gem! Made a reservation but still waited 20 minutes or so. It was ok as you see that people come to converse over fantastic french faire. Very much  bistro style, simple solid menu and a attentive staff. Wine list is a bit lacking but I liked the '09 Gigondas(good vintage and great subregion) with my calf liver and it paired well with the duck special. Prices are very reasonable, dinner for two with a bottle was $91.... Definitely worth trying for yourself... Just don't go the same night as me!"
1780,4,3.0,1,2013-02-02,"This place is pretty OK for brunch with groups of less than 4. The wait is usually short, especially compared with Penelope's (this was 20 minutes for us). However, the food is pretty average in my experience. I've had the grilled chicken sandwich and croque monsieur before and both were pretty bland tasting. However, they do serve a pretty mean french fry."
1781,4,4.0,1,2013-02-01,"Great food and service. Duck confit was well prepared. Would go back many times. Very small, cozy restaurant."
1782,4,5.0,1,2013-02-01,Love this place! The restaurant was on a street not on an avenue. The target customers are not tourists but mostly ppl in the neighborhood(like me) or ppl who learn about the restaurants through word of mouth. It was snowing on the day we went to this place for dinner and the place was packed. I ordered the Steak frites and the steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare as requested. The frites were amazing. My friend ordered the pork tenderloin with this herb butter sauce. The pork was perfectly cooked and it was very juicy. Food was good for the price.
1783,4,5.0,1,2013-01-28,Found this place by accident on a trip into NYC on a Saturday morning. Brunch was being served and is a good price for the city and comes with a mimosa. Additional is only $5 more and in New York that is not bad. Food was really good and quick service. Would def come back.
1784,4,4.0,1,2013-01-28,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in the city. It is located in Murray Hill in an unassuming neighborhood that is devoid of swarming tourists and whatever else walks the streets at 10am in the morning. When you walk in, you are immersed in a culture of clinking glasses, indistinct conversations about what happened last night, and the smell of good food. Atmosphere is casual, rustic French. The brunch special is a great deal, and for the quality of the food, is basically a steal. You mean I get a mimosa too with 12.95 of scrumptious goodness? Vous etes fous! I love anything French, and so I may be possibly biased. But good French food, like anything else, is hard to find under the many shams of a Croque-Monsieur that restaurants will often attempt to throw at your plate and expect you to devour it without complaints. In this case, I did order a Croque-Monsieur, which was toasted with just the right amount of butter, ham, and gruyere cheese. I also inhaled the side of potatoes and salad greens, leaving a glossy, shiny white plate. You know how your dog will finish all the kibble in his dish in about 23 seconds and then spends the next seconds voraciously licking his empty bowl? Yep. We did not make a reservation, and waited approximately 15 minutes for a seat to open up.   C'est magnifique. Looking forward to trying dinner here."
1785,4,4.0,1,2013-01-27,"My boyfriend loves mussels so I took him here back in 2012. We had the endive salad to start and it was so delicious, we ordered a 2nd salad. We also had the escargot, which was yummy and wished there were more, but we opted to forgo another one as we still had the mussels coming. For our entrees, he had the thai mussels and I had the espagnole mussels. He enjoyed his, as I did mine, but I did think his were better than mine. The mussels came with bread, but not enough of it to soak up that yummy broth. We requested more, and it still wasn't enough. The mussels came with fries and they were delicious, though a few too many were fried too dry. The atmosphere was very lovely and the service was wonderful as well. If it weren't so far in the city, we would go back. I remember spending about $70 before tax."
1786,4,5.0,1,2013-01-26,"Great traditional French food, such as moules-frites combined with a nice ambiance and reasonable wine prices. Really enjoyed my meal here and the owners were really friendly as well."
1787,4,2.0,1,2013-01-25,"food: onion soup - bland, lacks rich caramelized onion flavor, beet salad - decent but nothing to rave about, steak sandwich & frites - best thing out of the whole meal.   service: okay probably won't go back"
1788,4,3.0,1,2013-01-24,"Really delicious brunch, and right around the corner from my apartment! How did I just find this place a few weeks ago?! For $14, you get your meal, coffee or tea, and a cocktail. Downside - no bloody maries :-( The food was quite good though - I'll definitely be back for the price & proximity to my home!"
1789,4,4.0,1,2013-01-19,"The food was just delicious.  My favorite was the mussels (cooked with garlic and white wine), I just couldn't stop eating them!  They were so FRESH and cooked perfectly.  For main, we ordered Duck Confit and Pork Tenderloin.  The Duck Confit was yummy and had great texture however was just a tiny bit too salty (otherwise perfect).  The pork was delicious too.  The staffs were friendly and overall very cozy and pleasant dinning experience.  We'll definitely be coming back and try out rest of the menu."
1790,4,4.0,1,2013-01-15,Le Parisien: quaint restaurant with great service and food that's simply delicious.   They greeted us with complimentary wine while we waited for our table!
1791,4,5.0,1,2013-01-06,"Loved this place. Visited it during December 2012. The essence of a Paris bistro is perfectly captured in this place, and the food is wonderful. Had an Onion Soup and Steak & Frites. Absolutely loved them! Also, the staff and the owner/manager were very friendly and warm, made us feel welcome. Will definitely go back when we visit NYC again!"
1792,4,1.0,1,2013-01-05,"I've lived in the neighborhood for 9 years and my go to French bistro has always been Les Halles. Looking to try something else my husband and I decided to go to Le Parisien. One Friday night a few weeks ago my husband and I walked in to Le Parisien after our movie at Kips Bay let out. The maître d' greeted us at the door and we said ""table for two,"" and he said, ""ok, but you have to order right away because we close in 5 minutes."" Since it's a very small restaurant most of the patrons heard this and looked at us. What he should've said was, ""I'm sorry but we are closing in 5 minutes"" or something else along those lines. We would've understood. Embarrassed, my husband and I walked out and went to Les Halles. We'll never try Le Parisien again. What a terrible way to treat customers."
1793,4,5.0,1,2013-01-04,"Honestly loved this place.  I think it's great for taking fans of french cuisine to (even if they have actual experience from visiting France) or would make a perfect date night for that someone special. I have to admit that more often than not I order the Sautéed Calf's Liver as my entree, but that is just because it is soooo delicious and has never disappointed me.  It's extremely rich and requires a taste for liver, but if that sounds like your thing I promise you will be in heaven. We've sampled several of the apps and my wife always tries different entrees.  They've all been a hit with us, and our guests.  Roasted beet salad, French Onion Soup, and the Escargot all come to mind as recommended appetizers.  My wife has let me sample her Bistro Steak (great frites!) and her Duck Confit and they also come easily recommended. It's not just the food.  The service has been exemplary and the ambience feels like it's just a slice of Provence in NYC.  And the reasonability of the prices far exceed anything I have ever seen in NYC, with appetizers averaging $9-10 and the most delicious entrees starting at $16, but never exceeding $24 which in my opinion is a steal for the best French cuisine I have tasted in Manhattan so far. To the team at Le Parisien, I tip my beret to you!"
1794,4,4.0,1,2013-01-03,"Still loving this place.  Cute no pretentious bistro in the middle of Murray Hill.  They don't get super packed during the week and they let you linger but when you need fast service, they can accommodate that too. Super good French onion soup."
1795,4,5.0,1,2012-12-30,"Lunch with colleagues became a nearly two-hour gastronomic affair. This place takes their food French-seriously good: the roasted chicken was good-to-the-bone delicious and the starter onion soup brought back Paris memories to all. Creme brulee (whoa), profiteroles and the floating island with cappu ended our meal well."
1796,4,4.0,1,2012-12-23,Great value for the money! French toast was excellent and the eggs benedict were very good. Mimosa was great! Service was very good and the atmosphere was just like Paris. Would come again!
1797,4,3.0,1,2012-12-18,Wish I could give this place 3 1/2 stars.... Definitely one of the best options for brunch in Murray Hill. The eggs benedict is delish and you really cant beat the price of brunch. However on my last visit both myself and my friend commented on how dirty we thought the place was! The table next to us had a water glass that had white dust (or mold) all over it...pretty gross! Plus I found a bug in my water. The food was good but we both were turned off by the lack of cleanliness.
1798,4,4.0,1,2012-12-18,"Le Parisien is a comfy little Euro style bistro in Manhattan.  When I came here for brunch with friends, this place was packed.  I could soon see why.  The food was fantastic.  I really enjoyed the eggs benedict as it came out both fast and fresh.  Service was solid.  Pricing is all relative, but the quantity of food makes the pricing fair, but certainly not a steal.  Would nonetheless recommend this place to others.  Just have some patience when it comes to being seated for brunch."
1799,4,5.0,1,2012-12-17,Delish! Nice people and great food! The MUSSELS blew my mind!
1800,4,5.0,1,2012-12-16,Delicious dinner
1801,4,5.0,1,2012-12-15,"This place is awesome. The tight quarters, which I imagine may be disliked by some, really helps transport you to a nice Parisian bistro, which is, of course, this place's goal. I think it completely accomplishes this goal. The posters lining the walls, the dimly lit decor, and the European-accent-bearing staff all contribute to bringing me back to Paris. I started with the soup du jour - the cream of turnip soup. It was incredible. Sure, it was a bit heavy on the cream side, but I really couldn't complain because the turnip flavor wasn't masked. I thought I was taking a risk by ordering it, but it came through. I got the chicken as my entree. Some of the best chicken I've ever had. The mushrooms and gravy sauce complemented it perfectly. I highly recommend the chicken. We also split a bottle of the $31 Cotes du Rhone. It was definitely a quality wine. Maybe not the best Cotes out there, but for $31 in the city, definitely a good buy. I tried the ""floating island"" and the profiterole desserts, along with the two dessert wines. All of them were delicious. I especially recommend the ""floating island"" - airy but satisfying. Best part is that it's just a few avenues away from Penn Station, and it's quite cheap! Definitely worth checking out!"
1802,4,4.0,1,2012-12-15,"Parisienne mussels were amazing!  My friend ordered the Thai and was equally impressed.  We had the ice cream puffs with warm chocolate sauce and muscat wine for dessert.  The ice cream was a nice change from the usual cream filling.  The bistro was cozy and really felt like you were no longer in nyc, let alone Murray Hill... =P  We plan to return for brunch."
1803,4,4.0,1,2012-12-12,"A new neighborhood favorite.  Enjoyed a dinner for 2 on a weeknight.  I had mussels, my wife had chicken.  Service was polite, although a bit slow (the main criticism).  I'm generally critical of mussels, since I can prepare them well (and cheaply) at home.  These were definitely the best mussels, to memory, I've enjoyed at a restaurant.  My wife's chicken was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  You can easily pay twice as much and eat half as well for French fare in Manhattan.  9/10 for Murray Hill, 7/10 otherwise."
1804,4,4.0,1,2012-12-09,"I addition to yummy brunch...the dinner here is also really good. Last Thursday a friend and I dined here.  We each had French Onion soup, then we split the roasted artichoke salad and salmon over lentils.  For dessert we shared profiteroles.  Everything we ate was really, really yummy.  The soup was an awesome rendition of the classic recipe.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and the salad was unique and flavorful - very different than typical starter salads.   Everyone here is super nice!!  And I will definitely be going back soon."
1805,4,5.0,1,2012-12-07,"People keep giving negative service reviews, but the service here is awesome. I have had the same guy (manager or owner?) serve me every time I come here. Orders come quickly, they are attentive without being int eruptive to my conversation. Coffee gets filled. Turn around and nod for the check, I never once felt like I was waiting for something, and this is when the place was completely full and had two people at most working the tables. One of my favorite spots in this neighborhood. I have had dinner and brunch here."
1806,4,4.0,1,2012-12-01,"The entree-and-beverage-of-your-choice brunch special is now $13.95 (wampwamp) and it's worth it. Egg white and salmon gavlax omelette with herbs and french fries on the side? In. Dinner is great too. Regarding their service... come on guys. You get what you come for. You came to a very small, casual, Euro-style bistro. Not Applebee's. The owners aren't going to be at your table constantly poking you to ask if you're okay- they leave you alone to your conversation. Your coffee and water are refilled, food comes fast, they notice when you want your check. They might want to hire another waiter soon, but for now they're attentive enough for the bistro environment."
1807,4,1.0,1,2012-11-29,"Omg. The food is good here. The serivice, seriously, is the worst ever I've encountered in Manhattan. We made a reservation at 8, and when we were there perfectly on time, they said that the table wasn't ready. They told us to wait for 10-15 minutes. But in the end we waited for 30 minutes, without even being apologized AT ALL. So I started to ask the restaurant owner: "" do we get any discount or compensation for waiting so long?"" The owner said:"" no, This is Manhattan, and you don't give me this attitude. The door is right there, if you don't want to eat here, you can!""  This is ridiculous. We made the reservation because its my friend's 22nd birthday. Their bad service totally ruined our celebrative atmosphere. They might be popular, but that doesn't give them any reason to be rude. Such a shame for French restaurants. They are too rude to be rated anything more than 1 star. I am at the table now, and I am giving them zero tips."
1808,4,5.0,1,2012-11-29,"Small place, okay service, but fantastic food at a reasonable price.  Try the Duck or the Halibut that's on a bed of pea & mint puree."
1809,4,3.0,1,2012-11-25,"I live in the area and have been wanting to try this place for ages - I am a sucker for a French bistro.  I finally had the opportunity today when a friend asked if I was available for brunch. Although the place does not take reservations (as far as I know), we got lucky and had to wait less than 5 minutes. The service was pretty decent and our drink orders were taken immediately. The price fix included one drink and in an unusual turn of events, I skipped the booze and asked for just coffee.  My friend asked for decaf and I thought it was odd that they didn't have a regular decaf coffee but the waitress suggested my friend drink a decaf Americano instead.  I ordered the Poached Eggs with salmon and my friend ordered the chicken sandwich.  My eggs were extremely tasty although slightly cold but the French fries were fantastic - completely crispy without being greasy.  The spicy mustard sauce on the side was YUM.  My friend said her sandwich was superb. At first I felt a bit rushed - the waiter kept trying to remove my plate while I was still eating.  Granted, my plate was empty but I was nibbling on my friend's fries.  The price fix was a good deal, although all dishes were supposed to come with fries but for some reason, my friend's sandwich did not and she had to order them on the side.  I also did not like that they charged my friend for her Americano since the price fix was supposed to come with either a mimosa, bloody mary or a cup of coffee/tea.  Since decaf coffee was not available, I think her Americano should have been free but we didn't bother complaining. All in all, I thought the meal was good and the staff friendly.  The value was pretty decent and I would probably go back."
1810,4,4.0,1,2012-11-20,"Oooh la la. Tres magnifique! Love this tiny spot (which is actually not all that tiny upon entry.) It's really got a great French vibe, authentic French cuisine (go for the salmon et quinoa, mes amis!) Love the crowd, the ambiance, and the not too tight spacing of the tables (which will frequently occur in small restaurants.) Very sweet and friendly hostess / waitress. I'm only giving it 4 stars though because the bathroom was pretty gnarly. I watched a program the other day which interviewed a famous restauranteur who stated that a restaurant's bathroom tidiness is entirely indicative of the restaurant's kitchen cleanliness... Just saying. But not over-thinking it because I'll go back for another visit to Le Parisien. I'll just be sure to use my home WC beforehand!"
1811,4,5.0,1,2012-11-18,Went for dinner and it was amazing! Little french cafe with amazing food hidden in Murray hill. The chicken is to die for and so is the pork. We tried the apple tartin na dthat is the only thing that could be better...Would def come again!
1812,4,3.0,1,2012-11-14,"Solid, no frills brunch spot. The tables are teeny and packed into every corner so once you sit down prepare to move as little as possible. The French fries are delicious and the omlettes and French toast were great, too!"
1813,4,5.0,1,2012-11-11,"Only 4 stars?! This place is definitely underrated. A small hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant, and certainly, a hidden gem! Me and my friend came here around 1130-12 for the brunch. Mimosas were unexpectedly delicious and a perfect start to a meal. Ordered the poached eggs w salmon gravlax. Perfect. Could not finish the whole meal, but they also serve your brunch with a small salad and tasty frittes. The prices were very reasonably as well. I cannot say enough good things! I will be back!"
1814,4,3.0,1,2012-11-10,"This small eatery reminds of the small bistros in France all the way down to the French speaking waiters and customers. BTW, when people of a certain ethnicity dine at a place that serve said ethnicity's food, that's always a good thing. We had a reservation, but were given a slight wait which was not a problem. The Mrs. speaks French, and they responded right back. It's always great when non-American places can speak the language of the the food they claim to serve. For dinner, we split the baby spinach salad (ok) salad, she had the mussels; mariners and parissine (she enjoyed), and Steak Frites. They give you a lot of food for the low price. Everything was tasty. The Mrs. is a wine gal, and she wasn't very impressed with a wine list. A french place with a disappointing wine list automatically gets one star taken off. Overall, it is a nice quaint spot. It's great for a date night, on the first date or after six years (like me)"
1815,4,4.0,1,2012-11-04,This place is really small and cramped but has good food at reasonable prices.  I have been here a couple of times and have enjoyed both occasions. The French fries rock!
1816,4,5.0,1,2012-10-24,"Le Parisien - Cheap brunch special in Murray Hill! (cheap in price, not value) Bottom line:  Unbeatable $12.95 brunch special in a quaint French bistro. Tips:    The French toast is incredible!    $12.95 brunch special includes one drink    The restaurant is small and gets packed so make a reservation if you can About:  Le Parisien is a neighborhood gem in the heart of Murray Hill.  A small, quaint bistro with delicious food and rustic French decor, you feel like you're no longer in Manhattan as you take advantage of the unbeatable brunch special.  For just $12.95 you will get an entree and a drink (mimosa, OJ, coffee, or sangria)!  Chef Johnathan Masse, who comes from the Waverly Inn, does a great job bringing a comfort-food flare to this French bistro. Food/Drink:  While everyone loved their brunch, the French toast was the clear winner!  The food came out in a timely manner, and our coffees were refilled almost before we knew we were out.    French toast - With warm vanilla maple syrup, thinly sliced bananas and apple compote.  This was sooo yummy!  The apple compote tasted like apricot to me, and it was such a unique taste that went perfectly with the dish.  Loved how the bananas were sliced very thin so that they don't overpower when you take a bite.  This leads to the question... do the French really make the best French toast?...    Omelets - Both the herbs & roasted veggies omelet and the ham & cheese omelet were bit hits.  The spinach was particularly tasty in the herbs & roasted veggies omelet, but the egg wasn't cooked evenly throughout the omelet.  The ham & cheese omelet came with gruyere which added a flavor you don't normally get in this basic type of omelet.    Poached eggs with salmon - On an English muffin with hollandaise sauce.  We loved the crisp muffins and the eggs that tasted farm-fresh.  The eggs were cooked to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was well-balanced.  Also enjoyed the crispy French fries and salad that came with the dish.    Eggs benedict - With Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce - gets two thumbs up. Atmosphere:  Except for the unsightly, tiny restroom that is basically in the kitchen, I can't say anything negative about the atmosphere here.  It was a bit loud and only as people cleared out did we notice music playing in the background.  While the restaurant itself is small, it doesn't seem cramped.  Instead, it actually has an intimate, romantic feel, and would be great for a day date."
976,4,5.0,1,2012-10-24,"M suggested this place after learning that French is my all time favourite cuisine. I was a bit skeptical, only because why haven't I been here if this place is supposedly so good and I was definitely not impressed with Grape & Grain's food (another suggestion from M) M raves about their Escargot here - I must have to agree with M. Really tender and done perfectly well. However, I wish there was more garlicky goodness. Duck Confit - super moist and tender. LOVE LOVE LOVE Country Pate - didn't expect this to be so good, since some pate has a bit too much mineral taste, but this one I definitely enjoy. I do love pate, but it just depends on the taste of it. Creme Brulee - yums! Apple Tart - super soft and good, though pair with the Creme Brulee might be a bit too much. M wanted to get both. My new spot for French food! I am curious to try their moules!"
1817,4,4.0,1,2012-10-23,"Forever looking for my go to brunch spot (or more like one of many since NY brunch is just generally amazing), I decided to come to this cute little French cafe with a few friends. We came around two and there was a short wait, but after that, we were quickly seated and excited. Service was quick and the whole French cafe ambience was fantastic. All of us ordered the brunch special. I had the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax on English Muffins with Hollandaise Sauce with the sangria. The sangria was delicious and after just half of a glass, the warmth began spreading over my cheeks. I love poached eggs and salmon and thoroughly enjoyed my dish. My one complaint, and a minor one at that, is that the English Muffin was a little chewier than I would've liked. But all in all, I had a great time here and would definitely come back, maybe for a glass of wine."
1818,4,4.0,1,2012-10-19,"Went to dinner here last night, made ressies on Yelp and couldn't wait to eat French food.  This place did not disappoint.  Went with a girlfriend, we both enjoyed everything we got.  Started with the pate, then escargots, beet and goat cheese salad and the trout special. Everything was great.  The escargots had tons of garlic and you just wanted to sop up all that greasy yumminess with your bread.   The service was very warm and welcoming.  You did feel like you were in a quaint little Paris cafe. We had an early dinner at 6:30p and was surprised that the place was half full already.   Will definitely be coming back again."
1819,4,5.0,1,2012-10-17,"Exquisite food!  We stopped in after reading good yelp reviews. All four of us really enjoyed our meals. French onion soup that had broth that my palate reported had actually been slow cooked with beef bones, fantastic .  The carpacio very nicely done and also a generous amount. My daughter had the beet and goat cheese salad...nothing skimped on there either...lots of beets, lush goat cheese and a tasty vinaigrette.  Our two companions had the roast chicken and reported it was cooked to perfection sat atop good mashed potatoes.  We also ordered the creme brulee and profiteroles to split. Both desserts were beautiful presentations and tasted delicious.  We were all very full and happy especially since the prices were so reasonable.  Our entire bill was $120.00 including the tip!!  Very cozy and warm french atmosphere without the stereotypical red checked table cloths.  We loved this place and will return often."
1820,4,2.0,1,2012-10-15,"Bad service, average food. Two visits confirmed this."
1821,4,3.0,1,2012-10-14,I went to Le Parisien for brunch today and it was ok but nothing special. The decor could use some updating and the place seemed dirty to me. It was your standard brunch fare but nothing to write home about. There are better brunch options in Murray Hill.
1822,4,4.0,1,2012-10-08,Very traditional French menu. Food was fantastic!
1823,4,4.0,1,2012-10-07,"As i was walking in the neighborhood, I decided to got for brunch at le parisien today. Not only it is a great $ deal but food is awesome, and we love the cozy athmosphere, which always reminds me of my trips to Paris. Great food, fast service and a pleasant team. Will recommend to anyone ""Parfait"" as i believe says the French :-)"
1824,4,5.0,1,2012-10-02,"I've only been there for Brunch, and it was awesome! The egg dishes are delicious, so are the salad and fries that come with. The bottomless coffee they serve with the brunch is fresh and tasty. My friend ordered a sandwich, that was delicious as well. I can't wait to go back there for a proper French meal. This is a great neighborhood restaurant ran by real French people. The ambiance inside reminds me of restaurants in France."
1825,4,3.0,1,2012-09-28,"A charming spot, a welcoming staff, low noise level, good wine at a reasonable price...if only the food was better! The mussels were not very tasty (fresh?), the onion soup bland, the soup de jour very good, the bread so-so. The duck confit: very nicely served on frisee which overlaid thinly sliced potatoes. But, the duck was overcooked --tasty but dry and tough, the potatoes were not hot (chilled by the salad perhaps); the salad  with wonderful mushrooms was delicious. Coffees great, apple tart poor, not fresh."
1826,4,2.0,1,2012-09-23,"I was excited to come here when I saw it got 93% on Urban Spoon and when reviews described it as a nice departure to Paris in the confines of Murray Hill. However, this was NOT at all my experience. The French Toast was mediocre to say the least - I could have made better at home. The bread looked flattened and carelessly served. It was topped with little pieces of apple compote and maple syrup on the side. Don't get me wrong, it tasted fine but the presentation totally turned me off as I was expecting some fresh fruit or something remotely exciting to compliment it! I guess for $12.95 I can't be too picky about what I'm getting but in comparison to most brunch spots I've been to in the City the French Toast here was really embarrassing. To be fair, I haven't tried their other dishes but let's just say I'm not excited to go back."
1827,4,2.0,1,2012-09-17,"Me and my friend had brunch at Le Parisien. Food: We ordered classic egg benedict and french toast. The classic egg benedict was way too salty and the only good part was the fries that came with it. As for the french toast, it was a small portion and only served with maple syrup. The toast was overcooked and I can make a better toast at home. Service: Terrible! The waiter asked my friend at least 5 times if he could take his plate away (with an unpleasant tone) while there were still a lot of food left and we were just having a conversation. I could understand if there were people waiting to get into the restaurant but there weren't any people outside. It was very rude. Bottom line: Will not go back again."
1828,4,4.0,1,2012-09-16,"Cute little French restaurant in Murray Hill. The prices are very reasonable for the area and the food is consistently solid. Also, you can't beat their brunch deal - $12.95 for an entree plus mimosa, coffee, sangria, or oj. The eggs florentine come with a lightly dressed salad and skinny fries that are cooked to crunchy perfection. The french toast is fluffy and pairs well with the apple compote's sourness. The owner is French so you can guarantee the authenticity of the food. The space is quite small but not stuffy. We came here with about 8 ppl for dinner and were easily seated. The wait has never been more than 5-10 minutes which is a plus. This is definitely a needle in a haystack. For those with cars, there's parking right in front and it's free on one side M-F after 6 PM and all day Sat-Sun. The other side is free pretty much all day sans street cleaning however there's rarely a spot open. Bon appetit!"
1829,4,5.0,1,2012-09-10,"Full disclosure: I didn't really eat here.  I met some friends for a Sunday Brunch, and coincidentally 2 out of the 3 of them I joined for Sunday Brunch a week earlier in their hometown of San Diego.  And my biggest complaint at that place was that my coffee kept going empty, and when I get a coffee (or a water for that matter) at a restaurant, I want it constantly filled.  Le Parisien did not disappoint, as the staff kept filling my cup.  It was heaven. The brunch deal is not bad, either.  $13 includes a choice of meals plus a coffee or mimosa.  It was very tempting, but I wasn't hungry, yet.  I did try a few bites of my friend's croque monsieur and it was pretty amazing.  It actually left me bummed that I didn't order a proprer meal.  Next time."
1830,4,3.0,1,2012-08-27,"For someone who typically doesn't eat omlettes, this was a pleasant surprise.  Since most of the brunch options were omlettes, we tried the wild mushroom omlette and the spinach omlette (both with cheese).  Both were excellent, and we were happy with the overall deal.  We didn't understand the Yelp ""Deal"" since the ""special"" price we got from Yelp was the regular price, but they succeeded in getting us in the door.  And we're happy we found it, because it was a nice place.  My friend and I had just been to Paris a few months before, and this place did give us a feeling that we were back in one of those cute French cafes.  They accepted Amex too, which was nice.  Overall, I was happy, and will probably be back there for brunch.  I liked this place more than Penelope, which typically has a longer wait, and seems more expensive."
1831,4,5.0,1,2012-08-22,"A nice piece of Paris, a walk away from home in NYC. Excellent dinner here with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Made reservations and we were seated right away. Waiter was very attentive and very french. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay, suggested to us by the server. We had the duck pate and french onion soup to start. Both were delicious! Pate was flavorful and well presented, and the soup was piping hot and yummy. For our main, we ordered the Parisienne PEI mussels and the duck confit. The duck was perfection! A perfectly cooked thigh and leg with super crispy skin served on a bed of frisse. The mussels were very largely portioned and the saffron mustard sauce was great for dipping the bread in. We ended the meal with creme brulee and apple tart a la mode. Great laid back dinner with fine fine food. Will definitely be back very soon to try their brunch menu and many meals to come!"
1832,4,4.0,1,2012-08-20,"So glad I finally tried this spot out. Kind of a strange location (feels like it belongs more in the west village than murray hill) and doesn't look like much from the exterior, but once inside, this restaurant is a little slice of paris and perfect for a quiet dinner for two. I ordered the steak frites: the steak was tender and flavorful, and the fries were a bit overcooked but still good. My friend had the moules frites which was also pretty decent. Service was good and we didn't feel rushed even though we lingered awhile. Will definitely be back for brunch."
1833,4,5.0,1,2012-08-19,"~ $13.00 for one brunch meal + coffee (or mimosa).  Oh if only the mimosa were included, I'd be 200 % satisfied, but coffee plus free refills does it for me anyway :-) I love my crazy amounts of protein when it comes to brunch, and eggs just seem to be my NYC brunch craving.   We were a party of 6, and didn't make a reservation.  Brunch service starts at ~ NOON, and we all arrived at 12:15-ish and were still able to be seated right away (phew!).   Did I feel like I was warped into a Parisian bistro across the ocean?  Hmm...but I will dream anyway :-)"
1834,4,4.0,1,2012-08-19,Mussels with frites were incredible. Infused with fresh thyme celery onion and garlic. Cream broth light and very flavorful. Highly recommend. Nice and casual no pretense
1835,4,4.0,1,2012-08-16,"Came here specifically for the steak frites and was not disappointed! While the restaurant is very small (cozy?), our severs were great and very knowledgable.  Our waitress was a little unsure about the 2010 Bordeaux (apparently it wasn't a very good year) we were thinking of and instead suggested a comprable bottle to taste.  It was delicious and exactly what we were looking for in flavor. The bread was a little chewy, the type that sticks to your teeth but would be great with mussels.  The steak frites was very good; tender even though it is a tough cut of meat and the fries absorbed the sauce giving them a great flavor.   Looking forward to trying their brunch."
1836,4,4.0,1,2012-08-12,Love this place for brunch. Great service and good food for a reasonable price. What more could you ask for?
1837,4,4.0,1,2012-08-11,"I can't believe I've never stumbled across this tiny, unassuming Parisian bistro in my neighborhood! The prices are fantastic (ally low) - $12.95 for a ton of different brunch options that includes a mimosa, OJ, sangria, or coffee. My boyfriend and I opted for the brunch special of salmon gravlax over English muffins topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The fries and greens that it came with were divine. Crispy and not greasy, I downed my entire plate! The service was friendly. I really enjoyed it! What a great neighborhood gem."
1838,4,4.0,1,2012-08-01,"I can't believe I've lived here for so long and not stumbled upon this place for brunch. It's small, like a neighborhood café, but also has great service and a solid brunch menu. I got the poached eggs with salmon gravlax on English muffins (hollandaise sauce on the side) and it was so delicious and the perfect portion. It also came with some greens and really fried fries. The fries were okay and crunchy and oily enough on a day you are just so hungry you cannot have enough. I love the casualness of this place and the no-crazy-wait for a seat, plus it is great to come with a friend and have a good time without feeling hurried. The Kips Bay movie theater is literally a block away."
1839,4,5.0,1,2012-07-31,Highly recommend!! Visited on a Thursday night while in the city. We were greeted by the owner upon entering and seated immediately. The walls are covered in French decor - one poster looked to be of the owner - and the restaurant is small but intimate. The frittes and fries were amazing. Frittes was tender and the fries were the best we had ever had - hands down! Also ordered the pork in lime sauce which was very good and different then anything else I've ever had. Lots of dishes seem intriguing and different. By the time we left the restaurant was filled. Definitely suggest making a reservation if possible.
1840,4,5.0,1,2012-07-30,"Great atmosphere, delicious food. Usually come for their pre fixe brunch and it's a great menu with very tasty drinks included. The eggs benedict is a winner, as well as the french toast. My friends have given terrific reviews for the steak frits and chicken dish from the dinner menu also. The french fries are delicious and the French Onion Soup is some of the best I've had. Our waiter has been this charismatic French guy almost every time we've been here and is part of what makes dining her such a great experience. We come at least twice a month for brunch and occasionally dinner. Will definitely keep coming."
1841,4,4.0,1,2012-07-20,"had brunch here a while ago, good service, good food at a great price. I think it was $12.5 for a drink and an entree. But it was very small and it was very hot inside on a summer day, which was annoying."
1842,4,3.0,1,2012-07-18,Great local spot.
1843,4,3.0,1,2012-07-18,"We came in on a Tuesday night after being told there was an hour and a half wait at neighboring Cask. The restaurant was fairly empty and seemed well-priced, so we settled in for a relaxed dinner at this small, charming French restaurant. A friend and I ordered the special they were having - the pappardelle with mushrooms and spinach in a cream sauce... overall, I thought the dish was good (but not great). I was ready to eat after walking around all day, but the cream sauce was rich enough that the plate felt overly indulgent. Another friend at our table ordered the mussels, which came as a heaping portion in its own pot - very cute! The service was great - the manager kept stopping by to check on us, and let us finish our conversation well after the meal had ended, despite a growing crowd at the restaurant."
1844,4,4.0,1,2012-07-16,"Having visited Paris shortly before I ate here for the first time, I can tell you that this place is very authentically Paris. I have since eaten here again and again and not once has the food or wine disappointed. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is very intimate. Even my parents, who are old school Chinese and eat only Asian food, loved this place. The prices are reasonable for the kind of dining experience they provide. Will definitely come back on a weekend to try their brunch. A Croque Madame sounds pretty good right now."
1845,4,4.0,1,2012-07-12,"I visited this small hidden gem last week. What a delightful surprise. From the outside, it looks like a very small outdated restaurant. But as soon as you step foot inside, you feel the french style start to take over. We ordered the escargot and duck pate as appetizers, both were delicious and authentic. Escargot was light with only a little bit of herb and garlic oil and the pate was delicious with the cornichons (small pickles). Only suggestion for the pate is to ask for more bread, it wasn't enough to enjoy the pate fully. Since I wanted to try something new, I order the Thai mussel pot and my friend ordered pork tenderloin. My mussel pot came with fries which a little disappointing. The tenderloin was absolutely delicious. I would recommend it to everyone. The best of my entire dinner was the dessert...We had profiteroles. It's ice cream puff with warm chocolate sauce pour over it. DELICIOUS! MUST GET! It was so delicious my friend and I didn't say anything until the dish was finish. We were there on a Tuesday around 5:30pm. No wait. But it did get quite busy by the time we left which was around 7...The tables are close to each other so I would assume it would be quite nosy when it gets busy."
1846,4,4.0,1,2012-06-28,"BRUNCH REVIEW: I've never been to Paris, but Le Parisien paints the picture in my mind of what it might look like.  My friend & I managed to get the humongous open air window seat on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  It's $12.95 for a dish + mimosa, mary, oj, or caffee.  Eggs benedict & croque monsieur, both REALLY tasty.  The Sangria was a little weak for my liking, but I SUPPOSE my liver can use a break.  Service was very friendly and casual, definitely my style.  I'm coming back for dinner, be on your game Le Parisien (that's when the Yelp claws come out)."
1847,4,4.0,1,2012-06-27,"I really like the food here and the restaurant's ambiance lives up to its name - very quaint. The brunch here is pretty good. I would say, try the spinach omelet with goat cheese...sooo good."
1848,4,4.0,1,2012-06-21,"Love the brunch here.  French people know food.  My boyfriend and I come here almost every other week.  We have tried almost every item on the brunch menu and nothing has disappointed us so far.  Also love the fact that they have wifi here.  :-)  Not giving them 5-star is because of the single dinner experience.  We ordered a few appetizers, which were good but not impressive.  My boyfriend ordered the steak and he enjoyed it.  I ordered the special, monkfish wrapped by bacon slices.  It does sound yummy (and that's why three people in the group ordered it), but didn't taste as good.  We love the people working there.  Will come back to try stuff on the regular dinner menu and if something surprises me, I will review again.  :-)"
1849,4,4.0,1,2012-06-17,This is truly a hidden gem in the neighborhood. Went there for a special occasion based on the good reviews on Yelp and was glad I picked this place. The decor is nothing fancy. The wait staff (a French lady) was very helpful and refilled our water very promptly (always important). We had a bottle of bordeaux; the onion soup and salad which was on special for starters. The onion soup was okay & the salad was fantastic. I had the steak & frites as entree and it was very delicious. Steak was very tender- cooked to perfection. Frites were shoestring fries - very French. We also had mussels at the table and it was very good. I forgot the name of the dessert we shared but it was their recommendation and it was also quite good. Price very reasonable - everything came to about 110$ plus gratuity. We'd definitely come back again maybe to try their brunch!
1850,4,4.0,1,2012-06-17,"BF and I went for Saturday brunch after finding out a nearby spot was 45min-1hr wait. Firstly, there was NO wait here = +1. Very cozy spot and brunch prix fixe is $12.95 = +1. We got the grilled porto-mushroom sandwich w/ pesto sauce and the eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon. Both were very tasty = +1.  Waiters were just attentive and friendly enough without being too lurky = +1.  My only 2 suggestions for improvement are:  OJ was not fresh. BF said it tasted like Minute Maid and I agreed after sipping. A quaint, French spot like this should have freshly squeezed OJ, IMHO. Also, when I yelped, there was an advertised Yelp check-in special of ""$12.95 brunch "". When we got there, we found out it's not a check-in special. It's just their weekend brunch special for everyone. Maybe that should be revised.  Otherwise, we had a fantastic time dining here and will definitely be back, to try their other menu items."
1851,4,5.0,1,2012-06-17,"This was my first real French restaurant. I have to agree with others, it's like stepping into Paris for a moment. The moment you walk in, the owner greets you with french and sit me right away (it was Sunday night at seven, not really busy). We ordered: -French onion soup: authentic, so if you are used to chain restaurants like TGIF, then you will feel it has less taste and more bland. -Le Parisien salad with Vinaigrette dressing: delicious. I always love european salads! -2 of their daily special fish: my favorite was the spinach pea puree with special house made lemon sauce! DELICIOUS! I read many reviews and they suggested their mussels was something to order, but I mean mussels will always be mussels. If you are going to try French, do their special of the day, you can never go wrong with that! It is definitely a place to have dinner with a few friends, its not a place where I would like to go on a date. More homey than romantic. My first real French cuisine and I love it!"
1852,4,3.0,1,2012-06-17,"Cozy environment, OK food, fair wine. Make sure you get a reservation, the seating is rather limited."
1853,4,3.0,1,2012-06-08,def would come back here. nice little quaint restaurant. Duck country pate was crazy delish Couscous was goood but be ready for a curry flavored dish. Duck confit was da bombz but just one duck drum stick??? Really????!
1854,4,4.0,1,2012-06-04,"Absolutely yummy. Really excellent food in a very cute and relaxing atmosphere. The restaurant is quite small, but it doesn't feel cramped.They really know how to maximize the space. I was craving Moules Frites and my friend was craving Steak Frites. He was very satisfied, and so was I. I recommend the Parissienne flavor - saffron and mustard cream, a bit rich, very flavorful. Not shy at all on the Saffron. The Mussels were plentiful and perfectly cooked. The Frites, as other reviewers have mentioned, are deee-vine. Seriously. I was very full from the mussels, but I HAD TO FINISH my frites. They were so delicious. I usually use those little friend potatoes to pick up the leftover juices of the mussels, but no no, I didn't want to mess with the crispy goodness. They were perfect. Note: I've been before for their brunch special (~$13 for a beverage and entree). Not too shabby."
1855,4,4.0,1,2012-06-04,"I came here for brunch and had a great experience.  We got there right as the restaurant opened at noon and there was already a group of 5 - 6 people waiting to be seated.  We were quickly seated at a table by the large window, next to the entrance.  The weather couldn't have been better so it was the perfect spot to enjoy partial al fresco dining.  We ordered from the prix fixe brunch menu and had the eggs benedict and poached eggs with salmon.  Both were delicious and came with a bunch of fresh greens and crispy fries.  The restaurant itself is cute and cozy and the atmosphere is laid back and relaxed.  I will have to come back and try dinner."
1856,4,4.0,1,2012-05-31,"sssh!!    It's such a small place.  A piece of Paris.  You want ambiance?  You want wonderful food?  Great wine?  All at a reasonable price?  We love the mussels and frites as well as the chicken.  The bread soooo good.  ssssh, don't tell anyone else."
1857,4,4.0,1,2012-05-30,"This was definitely an unexpected surprise in the neighborhood. Very much trying to emulate a more realistic french setting without the pretentiousness, and providing more authentic and flavorful food, Le Parisien succeeds on both accounts. We had the raw beef plate as an appetizer...DELICIOUS! If some friends in your party are reluctant to try it but you're all for it, convince your friends it will make them a better person - it's worth trying! We had two types of mussel pots: one was thai and the other I can't remember...that just goes to show how memorable the latter was. I would say the thai flavor they offer is worth trying if only for the reason that it doesn't seem to be offered in many other places. And of course, the frites were solid too. Lastly, the service was great; the waitress was very willing to help us figure out what on the menu we might like best without being pushy or biased - can't ask for more than that!"
1858,4,5.0,1,2012-05-30,"I took my parents here for dinner and even though we were running late, the hostess told me to take our time and we were seated right away. It was quite charming and with the door and window open, the breezes took us away to a mini getaway. We shared a bottle of wine, multiple appetizers and all had the Steak Frites. It was tender and cooked perfectly for medium (rarely do I ever find a steak cooked the way I like it). I would love to go back to try their brunch. Overall, it was a very nice experience and I will definitely be back."
1859,4,3.0,1,2012-05-25,"I was on the hunt for good french onion soup and chose this restaurant because of the reviews.  I was disappointed.  The soup broth was slightly sweet but not rich and meaty as I was hoping.  The garlic was in large chunks and not finely chopped, which I interpreted as sloppy cooking.  The steak tartar was subpar and had too much dill and garlic.  The accompanying fries were ok - they had a slightly nutty flavor (from peanut oil?).  The chicken dish somewhat redeemed the restaurant.  It was moist and perfectly seared so that the skin was slightly crisp.  It came with a subtle but tasty sauce.  The restaurant itself was small but cute; what you imagine it would be like inside a Paris bistro."
1860,4,2.0,1,2012-05-22,The food is always delicious-wine choices nice. Ambience is like being in Paris BUT as I was taking a last piece of butter out of the round metal container I noticed there was ketchup in the bottom. Not the best. Made me wonder what else wasn't clean. It could have been worse and we got a free glass of wine. I will still go back. It's a gem.
1861,4,4.0,1,2012-05-20,We had a reservation and were seated right away. The place is nicely decorated. The lighting and ambience makes you feel like you're at a quaint little place in Paris. The owner who helped us herself is a French lady so that explains a lot of things. Huge wine selection. We decided to be a little adventurous and tried a bottle of South African red. It was tart but good. We had the pate appetizer and it was very good. They mix in pistachio and serve it with this thick dark sauce around the plate and bread. I had the mussels. It came in a huge bowl! I opted for the white wind sauce option and I was in heaven! I ate every single piece and dipped countless piece of bread in that amazing sauce. If I ever go back there I would have to go just to eat the mussels again. My sister had the fish. It was just okay in comparison to the mussels. The price was actually very reasonable for th area. Our bill for 2 came to about $90 after tax and tip.
1862,4,5.0,1,2012-05-14,"My wife daughter and I put in Google ""French"" for near her apartment , and this came up. We went, and thought it had mistakenly sent us to Paris. Like time travel, it was superb, manager/proprietor made us welcome (last ones in @ lunch closing), and kept kitchen open til we ordered. OMG, everything we got was wonderful, and my wife and daughter complimented me on my find. (Which they very rarely do-snooty women). So, my daughter is graduating next week, and that is the first place we will meet upon our arrival in NYC! Can't wait."
1863,4,4.0,1,2012-05-10,"Boire sans soif et faire l'amour en tout temps, madame, il n'y a que ça qui nous distingue des autres bêtes Pierre de Beaumarchais Can't be said any better. Oh, those french! But they are so much better then all of us in one thing  - hedonism. Forget about austerity - live here, now...and take all the pleasure you can get from life. Was always curious to check this place out. So on monday night I decided to go there for a glass of nice french rose wine and fois gras, to celebrate life!) The place is pretty tiny, but the atmosphere looks authentic. Reminds of all those french bistros with art deco style posters on the walls. Nice music. The wine was chilled and tasted great pairing with tender fois gras, served with crunchy cornichons, toasted baguette, mixed greens sprinkled with balsamic vinaigrette. I also tried their mussels in white wine with garlic, served with pomme frittes. Delicious. My friend tried their duck confit. I stole a piece, so believe me it's divine! The service was nice, very attentive and polite. Definitely will come back! Their brunch special looks good, so maybe thats what I'll try next. Merci, Le Parisien"
1864,4,4.0,1,2012-05-08,"I came here for a birthday brunch with a friend. Be warned that they don't take reservations for Sunday brunch but the wait wasn't too long. This is a tiny place so the turnover is quite fast. That said, if you're looking for a place to nurse a few mimosas for two hours, this isn't the place for you. The brunch menu is pretty basic, but for 12.95, you get a decent amount of choices. We had the Eggs Florentine and the Poached Eggs with Salmon Gravlax. Their hollandaise sauce is... in a word...delicious. The side of crispy fries was a yummy bonus. Also, every brunch order comes with a complimentary sangria, coffee, or mimosa too! What could be better! I would come back again, and would definitely like to try their dinner menu."
1865,4,5.0,1,2012-05-08,"From beginning to end, this restaurant is simply delightful. I came here on a double date with my S.O. and his out of town friends. Some highlights: --When calling to make reservations, the owner (an awesome French lady who doesn't seem to age) answers with an enthusiastic ""Bonjour!!"" and is super helpful and friendly. Just based on this encounter, I would dispel all my assumptions about ""rude French people"" --The ambiance: I've never been to France, but our friend has...she said it reminded her of a classic French cafe. It's tiny, and you're sitting super close to everyone. The walls are decorated with posters of French movies and such. Very, very, cute and chic. --In true European style, they let you linger. There is ample time between appetizer and entree, and of course you have to wait forever for the check. It's awesome not to feel rushed in a Manhattan restaurant. Now, the amazing French food: --The French onion soup comes piping hot out of the oven. It's extremely flavorful, down to all the elements: it has a sweet onion-y broth, a soggy but crusty crouton, and gooey cheese. --I tried steak tartare for the first time. It was quite an experience. It came with an egg yolk in a half shell, salad and a big heap of fries on the side. The ""steak"" was interesting...I have nothing to compare it to, but I think I liked it. The fries are out of this world..very potato-y and fancy. --We also got a dessert ""profit""something...it was everything you'd want in a French pastry The bill for 4, with 2 bottles of wine, was $200. That seems ok given the quality of food. Definitely come here for a special occasion when you have a few hours to linger and enjoy!"
1866,4,4.0,1,2012-05-03,This is a cute little French place with friendly service and good food.  It's a nice place for a quiet lunch.
1867,4,1.0,1,2012-05-01,"The waiter was sarcastic and dismissive of us and repeatedly suggested we get a bottle of wine instead of two glasses. He was pushy to the point of being forceful. My onion soup was good, but our table was rickety and uneven and tipped back and forth every time someone put their elbows down so a lot of the soup spilled onto the table and the floor. In addition, we were very concerned about the B cleanliness rating considering that even an A rating allows for a lot of less than desirable findings in the kitchen. Overall this was a very bad dining experience, which was particularly disappointing since I live around the corner and was hoping to go back!"
1868,4,4.0,1,2012-04-29,"Right off the bat, I just have to say that this place is adorable.  As a male, that's not a word I use often, so I mean it when I say it.  The restaurant is a quaint and cozy, with only a few tables inside and lots of vintage art and posters.  To make the experience all the better, there always seems to be at least one customer in there speaking French.  It could be a gimmick, it could be the owner, I don't know and I don't care because it just makes my dining experience that much better (although it also makes me sad that I do not speak French).   In terms of food, the brunch menu is reasonably priced at $12.95 with a choice of OJ, mimosa (for which they don't skimp on the champagne), sangria, or coffee.  The menu has all the classics--eggs florentine, frittatas, salmon benedict, and croque monsieur to name but a few--most of which are served with fries and mixed greens.  And they don't screw up most of your eggs like a lot of places.  The poached eggs neither instantly explode at the touch of a fork nor do they resemble a nearly hardboiled egg staring back at you (which is the worst).  I only wish the had a wider selection on their price-fixed menu, but I suppose it's better to do a few things well that a bunch of things mediocre. Not the best place for a large group, but a wonderfully charming, affordable brunch stop for a party of 2-4, with great service to boot.  I hope to visit for dinner one day soon!"
1869,4,4.0,1,2012-04-26,"This is seriously the most darling place.  The service is excellent and the ambiance is super charming.  The rainbow trout is perfection.  Excellent wine selection and beautiful salads to start.  Great for a sweet, intimate meal."
1870,4,5.0,1,2012-04-19,Very quaint and amazing food. Able to provide a little taste of Paris in NYC.
1871,4,4.0,1,2012-04-17,"I love this quaint, cozy Parisian restaurant! The menu offers great classics at reasonable prices. The escargot was the best I've ever had. The chicken was tender and juicy. The mussels were cooked well but the white wine sauce wasn't what I'd expected though it could be because I'm used to the less creamy version usually served at other restaurants. The service is warm and friendly. My only complaint was that the open air space turned the food cold quick!"
1872,4,4.0,1,2012-04-09,On the first night of a two-night stay I and 2 co-workers found this place. As we left after our wonderful meal we decided we'd come back again for our second night. This is unusual for me since I like to try as many restaurants as I can. But the cusine was very good and the staff was welcoming.
1873,4,4.0,1,2012-04-02,"Very good brunch deal.  No reservations for brunch, but the wait wasn't too bad for a group of 4 around 1230 Saturday morning.  There are always like 1-2 groups waiting but if you are a group of 2 it looked like you could get a seat right away.  Your full group must be there to get seated.  They were very strict on this. $12.95 for a meal + drink (sangria, mimosa, coffee, OJ).  The options all looked quite tasty and came with fries and a salad.   +My sister got the eggwhite with salmon- She said it was good, can't screw up a basic thing like that. +My mom got the french toast which was actually pretty good (I ate basically half of hers).  The only downside is that one of the french toasts wasn't fully cooked and raw inside...but overall the dish was yummy and comes with an apple compote on top.  It's no Exra Virgin french toast though. +I had the gruyere and ham omellete.  Very buttery but we are at a french place so what do I expect.  I would opt more for the Croque next time but I was trying to be healthy with the egg...drat!   +My friend had the egg florentine...she gobbled that up and said it was pretty good.   Additional comments: We all liked the fries...We saw many people getting the Frittata and it looked REALLY GOOD.  The mimosas were proportioned well.  The OJ is not fresh squeezed.  All 4 of us finished everything off of our plates..if you are a guy you may still be hungry. OVERALL:  Price wise, a very good deal and decent to good food.   The ambiance is cute..very Parisian bistro-ish.  The service was okay.  I like that we didn't have to wait too long."
1874,4,4.0,1,2012-03-30,"I love this spot for brunch. It is a truly quaint and peaceful spot for Murray Hill. The crowd ranged from elderly women who are clearly regulars, young couples and small groups of friends. The service was attentive and accommodating, the atmosphere was warm and authentic. Definitely didn't feel like I was right off of 3rd avenue. The prefixe brunch deal ($12.95  for a meal + Mimosa/Bloody Mary/Coffee or Tea) is great."
1875,4,4.0,1,2012-03-24,"Oh my! This place is teeny tiny. Be sure to get here before 12:30 because it fills up pretty quickly. I wanted to pretend Paul H. and I were in another city so I made a lunch reservation here. :) This place was surprisingly delicious. The bistrot steak was better than I could ever have imagined and the endive salad was bitter, sweet, and refreshing. This is definitely not a cheap and quick lunch but we managed to leave unscathed in under an hour. I noticed other patrons were nibbling on bread- we were not offered any so if you're famished (we weren't) you should definitely ask for some. :)"
1876,4,4.0,1,2012-03-22,"DECOR: 3.5/6 -Ten tables, mostly tables for two with one for a party of 6 SERVICE: 3.5/5 -friendly with an accent -free Wifi! FOOD: 4.5/5 -ENDIVE SALAD with roasted pears, roquefort cheese, walnuts and port vinaigrette: the walnuts were sweet which helped balance out the vinaigrette. The pears weren't sweet but juicy. The endive added the extra crunch. -BISTROT STEAK FRITES with red wine thyme sauce and carmelized shallots: I had this medium rare and it was cooked right. The meat was tender and easy to chew. The frites were cooked perfectly. No excess grease/oil and when mixed with the red wine thyme sauce, perfecto! -Get both dishes to balance each other out."
1877,4,5.0,1,2012-03-22,"My hubby and I love this charming bistro and are becoming regulars!  (It's so exciting to become a Regular somewhere, you know?)  Pretty much always packed, it's a true neighborhood gem.  There are often people waiting outside for a table on frosty winter weekend evenings.  They take reservations in advance (but none the day-of, I don't think.)  Would definitely recommend making a rese!  Otherwise the wait can be a little bit of torture, as you sit there smelling all the delicious food.  Weekend brunch is a great deal - the grilled chicken sandwich with tomato, arugula, asiago cheese, and tomato vinaigrette is my favorite!  (Thinking of it right now makes my stomach growl.)  For dinner, I recommend the beet salad (very fresh!) and classic French onion soup for appetizers and my hubby always gets the escargot.  My entire family loves the filet of sole for the entree (especially my dad, who doesn't like French food in general).  The specials tend to be quite good.  We haven't had a chance to try the mussels yet - all the other dishes are that yummy!   Love the French service - they leave you alone to talk.  Refills of water are fairly frequent, though they may need a hint, depending on how chaotic it is in there.  We have some favorite wines on their wine list.   One of our favorite tables is the one by the window!  Also note, the bathroom is quite small in the back right corner.   Overall, very cozy and great for many occasions (date spot, dinner with parents, brunch with friends, etc.)."
1878,4,5.0,1,2012-03-20,"My friends and I split the escargot, and I had the roast chicken and apple tart.  One friend had the sole, and she absolutely loved it.  They also had a creme brulee, which they said was amazing.  Cute, small place (got quite crowded by the time we were finished eating), with very friendly waitstaff."
1879,4,4.0,1,2012-03-03,"Unassuming little place in an unexpected location. I'd probably walked by it million times without taking note, but all the positive reviews on Yelp caught my eye. I came here with 2 friends for dinner midweek. The space is small and the tables are close together, so it's better for small parties (or dates!). I wasn't very hungry that night, but I tried a little bit of everything on the table and thought it was all delicious. I lived in France for a few years and while that doesn't make me an authority by any means, I definitely know what I like. And I reallyyyyy liked Le Parisien. The restaurant seems to be run by a very friendly, very French husband and wife team who do all of the serving. Highly recommended!"
1880,4,2.0,1,2012-03-02,"I have to say, I was disappointed by my visit to Le Parisien. After walking past and wanting to try this cute French place for years, I finally suggested that two girlfriends and I come here for a late brunch last Saturday. While the friendly buzz and cozy decor were perfectly charming, the authentically-French service left something to be desired. I'm a pretty undemanding diner, but have to admit that I found the lack of attention from the waiter/host pretty annoying. After all, the tiny cafe was not full, and it still took 20 minutes for him to acknowledge us after we sat down. The poached eggs and salmon with hollandaise was certainly tasty, but the accompanying fries were cold, so I didn't eat much of them. And, weird as it may be to complain about this, the tap water tasted gross."
1881,4,5.0,1,2012-02-26,"I break from my vegetarian diet for French food, so I am always happy to find a place that has such well-executed classics. Le Parisien features deliciously prepared escargots, poulet rôti, and moules marinières. The moules Parisiennes were also quite good (with mustard and saffron cream sauce), but there is something so wonderful about the classic marinières. These were accompanied by herb seasoned frites, which is a style of French fries that I'm seeing in many restaurants these days, and enjoying very much. The first time I tried to eat at Le Parisien was a Saturday around 7, and there was absolutely no room for me and my friends. My recommendation is to arrive for an early dinner before a show or a movie. When my friends and I showed up at 5:30 on Thursday, we were the only ones there for the first 20-30 minutes, and it was packed by the time we left."
1882,4,4.0,1,2012-02-24,"I was craving something different this week and for the first time ever I decided to try French cuisine.  I must say that after spending an evening at Le Parisien I later told my boyfriend ""After eating in this place, I am going to move to France"".  Please note I have never been to France, nor do I know french. This cozy little French bistro has the kindest wait staff ever.  My friend and I ordered a bottle of red wine, which the waitress let me taste to see if it was to my liking.  I ordered filet of sole in a lemon and butter sauce with green beans and almonds.  My friend ordered frittes and steak.  She said her food was excellent.  I practically inhaled my plate.  The only critique I truly have is for the price, my fish was really small portioned.  I was hungry later.  Honestly though, I was having such a great time I did not care. For dessert, we split a merengue thing the waitress describes as ""heaven"".  And I tell you, it was nothing less. I will most certainly be back here to take advantage of their prix fixe brunch for $12.95 for sure!"
1883,4,4.0,1,2012-02-20,"Very cute place. Scratch that. Quaint place! Frequented by REAL French people, run by REAL French people (but also exceptionally friendly, attentive and fast), and real french food. Only the baguette wasn't as real, or at least it was pretty old. I had the carpaccio, which was super thin and delicious, and topped with arugula, cheese, and - surprise - thinly sliced green beans with mushrooms. I've never had it like that, and I liked it! Then I had the mussels with garlic and white wine sauce, which was succulent and satisfying. No room left for dessert, especially after I read on Foursquare that the cream of the cream brulee is served cold, which is not how I personally prefer it. In short, what I loved most about Le Parisien is that is does feel like a REAL transplant from Paris. Go try it out!"
1884,4,5.0,1,2012-02-18,"The place is small so it wouldn't be good for big groups but I like it quaint and cozy. Everything I ate here was absolutely perfect and I finished EVERY SINGLE PLATE. I started with the le parisien salad with vinaigrette dressing and got the pappardelle pasta with roasted cherry tomatoes, basil, and asiago cheese. For dessert, we got some warm cream puffs with vanilla ice cream on the inside, drenched in chocolate (don't know the name because they didn't give us a dessert menu and the waiter just told us what they had). Waiters were nice and friendly. It's a bit pricey, but worth the experience. Can't wait to go again :D"
1885,4,4.0,1,2012-02-15,"A neat little place. I have had the steak frites 3 times and there's a reason.  It's good.  Very good.  Consistently.  I have had the beet salad, onion soup and other apps: all good.  I come back for a reason; it's close to my apt., it's good food that's easy and it's a relaxing restaurant.  Easy in, easy out.  Not for 50th wedding anniversaries (take her to Jean Georges) but on every other day of the week, I'd say here's a good spot."
1886,4,3.0,1,2012-02-12,"I love French food. I absolutely love it. In fact, I consider myself somewhat of a Francophile. It was last minute and my friends and I wanted to go out to in the city, on a Friday night, without reservations. This really limited the amount of places we could go to. After a while, after looking through opentable, I settled on Le Parisien. The decor is quite lovely, and the restaurant has a nice, cozy French bistro feeling. Now onto the food. My first dish was a special, it was a dish of fried oysters with risotto, all fried together. The dish wasn't anything special, as it just tasted fried, but I couldn't tell that I was eating oyster because it was so deep fried and it was almost like eating the skin of a deep fried chicken, with a bit of a seafood aftertaste. My next dish was their chicken. The chicken was quite good and the mashed potatoes on the side were very delicious. It was pretty good, but again, nothing memorable. I had dessert too, the Apple pie, or more like Tart Tatin. That was good. This place was good, but not great. I will probably not come back here for a while because there's too many other French restaurants I have to eat at and this place didn't produce too memorable of a dining experience for me. But maybe someday I'll be back..."
1887,4,5.0,1,2012-02-11,"i felt like i was in paris again! the food was excellent. perhaps the best salmon i've EVER had. EVER. steak frites was spectacular. french onion soup was close-your-eyes-and-take-a-moment good. endive salad with poached pears, walnuts and roquefort was not only so delicious i didn't want it to end, it was also presented so so so beautifully. creme brulée was perfect, profiteroles were decadent and gorgeous. the service was superb, and very hands-off, which i liked. (and which reminded me of being in paris) we had a reservation for 7.30 on a saturday evening and it was completely full. i would definitely advise making a reservation rather than taking your chances on this tiny, exquisite place! we can't wait to go back. bon appetit!"
1888,4,5.0,1,2012-02-06,"If I could give this restaurant more stars, I would! This was one of the best restaurants that I have been to. Ever. We ordered a bottle of the Sancerre, Domaine Durand wine, which I had never had before and it was great! Our appetizer was the muscles mariners, and they melted in our mouths. For my entree, I had the pan roasted chicken, and everything on the plate was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. For dessert, I had the lightest creme brûlée that I have ever eaten in my entire life. The service was absolutely outstanding - I couldn't have asked for better. They were quick, attentive and very knowledgeable. More than willing to answer any questions. The woman who was there (I should have gotten her name) was so sweet and a wonderful hostess. I will be going back!"
1889,4,3.0,1,2012-02-01,"For a meal as competitive as brunch in NYC, I was hoping for better from Le Parisian. The tables are very close together- they actually needed to pull out the entire table for my (skinny) friend to squeeze into her seat- and the restaurant itself is pretty teeny, making it a noisy dining experience. The meal itself was fine. The menu is typical brunch, and we both had smoked salmon eggs benedict. It was good, not memorable. For a french place, I was just expecting more character. Even in Murray Hill, there are other brunch options that I'd prefer."
1890,4,2.0,1,2012-01-27,"Super sad to report that I wasn't impressed by my brunch @ Le Parisien. The place was pretty bustling at prime brunch time on a Saturday - albeit a terribly rainy/snowy one. The tables are somewhat cramped together but it reminded me of restaurants back in Paris! Super cozy feel. My friend ordered the roasted veggie omelette and I had the Croque Monsieur. I had super high expectations for my sandwich because I've them in France and they were the bomb.com! Sad to sad that I was disappointed w/ the huge glob of congealed gruyere on my sammie...everything just tasted so mediocre. My friends omelette looked pretty lackluster as well. Since it is in my area, perhaps I will give this place another shot since J'aime la cuisine française ;)"
1891,4,4.0,1,2012-01-15,Great quality food so far :)
1892,4,5.0,1,2012-01-15,Great eggs benedict. Highly recommend for brunch.
1893,4,5.0,1,2012-01-14,"The menu was relatively simple but the food was exceptional and service was welcoming and friendly. I hesitated to give 5 stars but I believe if the food was that good and if I can't find one criticism in service or ambiance, then it deserves 5 stars."
1894,4,5.0,1,2012-01-12,Excellent place for brunch!!!  Relaxing atmosphere...AMAZING FOOD!!!!
1895,4,4.0,1,2012-01-11,"(This review is an homage to the Yelping with Cormac Tumblr. You should start keeping up with it if you haven't been, as it's hilarious.) Midtown - New York, NY Four stars. We should find Billy. I need a rosé first. Judd settled into his dust laden chair easing his windshorn coat off his back and accepting the flimsy menus traced their edges with uncalloused bemused hands. Manuela's shifting glances drew his attention to the matron standing at their sides surveying their attire and surmising their occupations. You are not French. No but I'd like a rosé all the same ma'am. He regarded the room. Striped sweaters pierced the pulsing darkness like faraway bonfires in a desert wasteland. The rosé is not available tonight. She stood silently gazing over his face unchanged at the tersely delivered news. How are your peas? As sweet as peas naturally are. I'll take the pork. The pork will do just fine indeed."
1896,4,5.0,1,2012-01-10,"Sometimes it's hard for me to decide if any given restaurant deserves a 4 or 5 star review.  But if any restaurant serves me something that is ""close your eyes and savor the moment"" delicious, it's an easy call. Here it was the french onion soup.  The flavor explosion of my first bite absolutely rocked my socks. Let me back up a bit.  We were seated relatively quickly around 8:30 on a Thursday night, but with a place this small, I can see it being hit or miss.  The waitress was  funny and helpful, and even had a little bit of a french accent to lend the experience a little extra dash of authenticity. I ordered the bistro steak frites and my fiance got the salmon.  Both were delicious, but our excitement was a little tempered because we were still recovering from the appetizers and their mind blowing deliciousness.  I mentioned that the french onion soup almost made cry, and she couldn't stop talking about how her roasted artichoke salad was the ""most delicious thing she ever put in her mouth."" We also had dessert, but I can't remember what it was called.  It's a shame, because that was delicious too. Put it all together with a reasonably priced bottle of wine, and it was an excellent dining experience."
1897,4,4.0,1,2012-01-08,"If you ever feel like visiting Paris but don't have the money to make the trip, head over to this little French restaurant to get your Paris fix! My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and felt like we were transported to a little (okay, tiny) bistro in Paris. We had called ahead, so we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table, which is good because there isn't much room to wait! We ordered the escargot, the mussels, and only one entree, the duck, all to split. It was the perfect amount of food, and it was all absolutely delicious! The mussels were really great because we chose the Spanish version with tomatoes and Chorizo, which was a nice spin on the traditional white wine and garlic option (which they also offer). We would definitely come back to just get wine and mussels some time. So tasty. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place (but only for parties or 2 or 4, tops). Bon appetite!"
1898,4,5.0,1,2012-01-07,"C'est si bon!   There was one douche-y Frenchman running the place. He sat us by the door, which we weren't happy about. But we were so weak from hunger we could not fight. I had coffee and my alcoholic date had the sangria(his reasoning- why not?). We ordered the French toast(what else would you order in a French place?) and the mushroom/asiago omelet. My date nearly had an orgasm at the the mere smell of the French toast with apple compote. It was that good. The omelet was fluffy with a perfect balance of fungus and mold. The douche-y Frenchman turned out to be a bit of a comedian.  A patron approached him looking for the bathroom. Francois told him the bathroom was on the tree to the left of the door, the customer believed him, and headed out the front door! HA! He actually went for the door. Of course Francois stopped him and pointed him to the real bathroom, but it was hilarious. I wanted to hate the guy, but he was the perfect combination of snob and hilarity, and the food was terrific."
1899,4,5.0,1,2012-01-07,"5 star french brunch.  Thank you yelp for your droid app and allowing us to find this spot.  After an hour wait at our first choice, we decided that this would be our alternative because we were hungry.  This place turned out to be second to none.  We were greeted at the door by a Frenchman who I would imagine as the owner or manager whom was a little crude at first.  His crassness dissipated as we saw his sense of humor a few moments later.   As we were eating our food, a guy asked where the bathroom was and with a seamless reply, frenchie said ""outside to the left on the first tree.""  The guy proceeded to head outside of the restaurant until frenchie stopped him as we all laughed out loud.  I'm talking about a good hearty one.  That made our brunch even better. The food? Delicious.  As soon as the french toast was put in front of me my mouth started to water from its delicious smell.  The first bite was just as good as I had imagined it a few moments earlier.  The mushroom omelet was cooked perfectly as the eggs were fluffy and cooked to perfection.  For 12.95 including a coffee or sangria, its a great bargain and a place where Ill be coming back to."
1900,4,4.0,1,2012-01-03,"This review is for brunch. The eggs were poached perfectly and there was plenty of salmon, the small salad and fries made for a perfect balance. 12.95 with a mimosa. Yum. I'd go for the mimosa over the coffee by the way. For a French spot the coffee is only so-so."
1901,4,4.0,1,2011-12-28,What a delightful restaurant!  We had an eye doctor appointment and looked for some place in the neighborhood until the appointment. Le Parisien fit the bill. Endive salad with Roquefort pears and walnuts in vinegrette was wonderfully refreshing and delicious. Roasted chicken was moist and flavorful. Mussels juicy and tender and good frites along side made Le Parisien a restaurant that I wish was in my neighborhood. Bravo!
1902,4,5.0,1,2011-12-27,"I loved this place!  It seemed so cozy when we walked in.  It had nice decor and service was great as well, but that's not even the best part.  The food we ordered was delicious.   I came with a few people.  We ate the bistrot steak frites as well as two of the specials: the striped bass and the coq au vin.  The food absolutely blew us away.  The frites were very addicting.  Not to mention the striped bass was cooked nicely with its slightly crispy skin covered in lemon and sitting atop asparagus and almond puree.  I could go on about how delicious it was but it's better to try it for yourselves. We didnt stop there though.  We also ordered all three of the desserts.  I'm not too sure of what the names were but I know one was the creme brulee, another was an apple pie and vanilla ice cream, and the third was another pastry with vanilla ice cream inside covered in chocolate.  These were also equally as delicious.  The apple pie wasnt too sweet so it wasnt overpowering and the vanilla only helped to make it better. The only item we werent too fond of was the duck pate appetizer.  It wasn't our favorite, but all in all, we all agreed we'd definitely come again."
1903,4,5.0,1,2011-12-24,I had the escargot and the Sole fish. The escargot was like any other escargot anywhere..... Delicious. The Sole fish was perfectly cooked. I don't remember the sauce that it came with it but it tasted somewhat like hollandaise sauce. I really enjoyed this meal it was truly delectable.
1904,4,4.0,1,2011-12-21,"I've been to this place many times for a quick casual brunch for $12 - you get a drink of choice with it. It does truly remind me of a French place that is warm, cozy, and service is on point.  I'd definitely recommend for people to try this spot.  Never been for any other meal, though."
1905,4,4.0,1,2011-12-20,"Lunch Winners: Ham & Cheese Sandwich, just do it The wine Mussels Frites special. $15 for Mussel Frites or Chicken breast with a soup or salad. Frites 3 Cheese sandwich Losers: Chicken Breast: a bit dry Butternut squash Apple soup: Why the apple... made an otherwise delicious soup into a hearty soup with a tart snap.  It sounds good, but it's the kind of tart of an apple that dries out your mouth.  I forget which apple specifically..  Everytime I took a spoon of it, it felt like I was biting into an apple in a bad way. Comments: 1) I would like to order the apperitifs but I see bottles of Punt e mes in broad daylight.  Isn't that stuff supposed to be stored in the fridge? 2) It's a good lunch if I'm feeling fancy."
1906,4,4.0,1,2011-12-13,"I had an excellent brunch here a few weekends with girlfriends. The space is somewhat small but we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. It has a quaint cafe vibe with very friendly service. We did the prix fix brunch where you get a Mimosa/Bloody Mary/Coffee or Tea for $12.95. I had the eggs benedict florentine and it was excellent. The poached eggs come on top of crispy english muffins with a delicious, very fresh tasting sauce. I've had cravings for it since. The dish comes with a salad and shoestring fries on the side. Great spot for convenient Murray Hill dining, I'll definitely be back!"
1907,4,4.0,1,2011-12-07,"What a wonderful little French bistro. The atmosphere is very cozy, the wine list is pretty extensive and well priced, the food is delicious. Our party of 2 had the roast chicken and the Parisien mussels - but everything on the menu looks like a winner. The only negative was the dessert - we had creme brulee and it tasted like it was made a few days ago and the sugar on the top was soggy. If you're in the neighborhood, do try this place."
1908,4,4.0,1,2011-12-05,"Came here with the VERY special Lady Friend and a good friend of mine for Brunch one day.  We were looking for a spot in the Murray Hill area and was going to try Penelope's but remember the lines.  This place is right accross the street from the 2nd ave deli.  so that line is also CRAZY.  there wasn't a huge wait for a seat, which i don't mind, as the place is relatively small, and didn't have enough servers and other help.  Some might call it quaint, rustic and intimate.   While the place definitely has a charm about it, i didn't really appreciate the small seats and tables.   but the food is VERY GOOD.  I had an Eggs Florentine and the eggs were almost perfect.  (slightly overdone) everything else on the plate was light and delicious.   My Lady had a mushroom omellete and it too was very well done with good flavors.   My Friend had the Chicken ""Sandwich"".  He said it was very tasty as well. I like this place, and feel like i should give it a shot for dinner, or any other meal.  but as a brunch spot it definitely serves it's purpose.  would do it again."
1909,4,4.0,1,2011-12-05,"Le Parisien, I like the name already by just hearing it. Saturday, we went here for brunch. A small old style looking restaurant, make you feel you are outside the city (but it's located in Manhattan). And I like the lighting and their photo decorations on the wall. Food was great! I ordered Omelet of Wild Mushroom and Asiago Cheese with a salad with French fries. Omelet done perfectly and the side salad was yum. My fiance ordered Eggs Florentine with a salad with French fries. Oh it looked so attractive just by how it plated. This dish was perfectly delicious for me, but eggs were liiiittle bit over cooked by his standard (he likes egg yolk halfraw). His friend ordered Chicken sandwich with arugala and tomatoes, also a balsamic vinegarette. A bit mess while eating since the sauce and stuff inside kept on falling out. But he loved it. Service was a bit slow since we only saw two waiters, but still nice in general. Only thing I didn't like as much was the bathroom, it was quite small, but clean tho. =]"
1910,4,5.0,1,2011-12-02,I created a Yelp account just so I can review this place.  It is awesome!  I've probably eaten there 15 times and each time I left fully satisfied and impressed.  The food is delicious and the staff is attentive without be intrusive. Give this place a try!
1911,4,4.0,1,2011-11-28,"Blocks away from the madness and chaos of Penn Station lies a quaint French restaurant. Le Parisien keeps tradition with staples such as French onion soup, steak with fries and escargot. For less than fifty dollars (split two ways), I enjoyed a bottle of wine, an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. For a low key meal with extraordinary taste and ambiance, Le Parisien is it (skip the trendy Pastis in the MPD and come here). PS: Come back for the unlimited brunch for 12.95 on the weekend."
1912,4,4.0,1,2011-11-25,Love this place for brunch!  Totally french but that's why everything there is so good.
1913,4,4.0,1,2011-11-24,"A little gem in the giant crappy irish bar that is Murray Hil.  Small but cozy spot, low key, French cafe/bistro ambience.  Solid moule-frites, decent wine selection, seems owned and operated by the owners."
1914,4,4.0,1,2011-11-11,"Le Parisien, mon amor! 10 years of French lessons have left me still woefully unprepared to profess my affections for you so clearly as I'd like to, so I will keep this short, sweet, and in English. Le Parisien is an adorable, cozy, affordable French bistro conveniently located in the heart of Murray Hill. I've been 3 times for brunch with 3 different sets of people and once for a solo dinner and have always had a great experience. The staff is friendly and accommodating and the food is classically delicious. If you come for the $12.95 brunch w/ 1 free drink, make sure you or somebody in your party orders the croque monsieur and that you get to taste it, because it is AMAZING. Plus: if you want a croque madame, they will add the egg at no additional charge! I also recommend the eggs florentine, because hollandaise, eggs, and spinach are apparently a match made in brunch food heaven. As for the drinks, both the mimosas and the sangria are tasty with good ratios of fruit juices to alcohol. Since the only time I came here for dinner it was by my lonesome, I can't comment on anything outside of the PEI mussels (which were perfect!) and the wine by the glass (standard $8 glass, good wine), but I can tell you I know enough from that and the brunch to plan on coming back for dinner soon. The best part of all is that I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table here, ever, and with the exception of the 1st time I came I've always just walked in. Not to say the restaurant is empty - they just seem to turn tables over pretty efficiently without having to rush anyone out the door. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed!"
1915,4,5.0,1,2011-11-06,Im not particularly fond of Murray Hill.. but I'll make an exception for Le Parisien. I have been here for both brunch and dinner... not once have I been disappointed. The clams are to die for..and the wine is reasonably priced. Go!
1916,4,4.0,1,2011-10-28,"Who does not like shoe-string fries! ? Seriously! If I could eat these fries daily and not be bothered by the fact that I have now morphed in to a giant hippo- I could die happy. In a nut shell: Great lunch specials, awesome food, my only bone is... well Zagat gave it a ""b"" ! But then again - what does Zagat know!? I could crush Zagat if I wanted to... just sayin..."
1917,4,4.0,1,2011-10-28,Cozy little French place that serves fantastic duck confit.  Would love to come back here again to try their mussels and onion soup.
1918,4,3.0,1,2011-10-20,"So while I was waiting for our brunch table, I felt something fall from the ceiling onto my hand... and much to my surprise it was a cockroach / waterbug.   I jumped back and the bug fell to the floor, and then the manager skillfully kicked it out of the restaurant.  As in, he literally busted out some soccer kick using the side of his shoe and hurled the bug intact into the sidewalk (guess it's better than killing the bug). Afterwards he sheepishly turned to us and said, ""You still want to eat here?""  If so I can seat you right now."" To be fair, I was standing in the doorway near air conditioner unit so I can't tell for sure if the bug came from inside our outside.  I also did take the manager's offer and wound up eating a perfectly fine, 3.5-star brunch, which given my experience I hope no one will mind if I go ahead and round that down to a 3."
1919,4,4.0,1,2011-10-18,"I've eaten here twice over the last 2 weeks and really liked it both times. The restaurant is tiny but quaint and the staff is very knowledgeable. The first time I went there, we had dinner, and it was really exceptional. I got the crispy duck confit (would definitely recommend this) and we shared the carpaccio and escargot appetizers. Everyone finished their plates clean. Last weekend I tried it out for brunch, and it's really a great bargain- $12.95 for brunch and a drink of your choice (coffee, sangria, or mimosa). You can't really beat that in NY! My roommate got an omelette which was nothing special, but I got the fritatta which was pretty good. Great neighborhood spot!"
