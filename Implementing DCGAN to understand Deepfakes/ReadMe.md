## Implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)

In this project, all individual elements of the DCGAN such as **Generator** and **Discriminator** are coded from scratch to form the **DCGAN**.

We use this MNIST dataset to train our GAN to generate images of class '0'. 

Here is the link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf

A short image of how a GAN works can be seen in the picture below:
